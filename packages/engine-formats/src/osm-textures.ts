/**
 * The `.osm` `TEXS` section (plan opensa-pack/003 phase 5): a model's dictionary as one or more `.ostex`
 * arrays.
 *
 * A `texture2d_array` holds ONE size and ONE format, so a model whose textures disagree cannot fit in a
 * single array. The first shape of this section assumed it could, which held for vehicles (the builder
 * buckets them into one array) and for clutter — but peds break it: **23 of 265 stock peds mix texture
 * sizes**, and map objects will break it harder.
 *
 * The alternative was resampling every layer onto a common size. That is rejected by decision (user,
 * 2026-07-19): resampling regenerates the mip chain map-optimizer authored, and the chain is the thing we
 * are protecting. So the ONE-ARRAY-PER-MODEL contract gives way instead — a consumer addresses a texture as
 * (array, layer), and a single-array model is simply the `arrays.length === 1` case.
