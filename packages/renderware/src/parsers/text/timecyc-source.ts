/**
 * Which timecyc file the world runs on (plan 104/01).
 *
 * Three names can carry the table and every reader must prefer them in the SAME order, so the order lives
 * here once and nowhere else. Two of the three are 24h as authored; the third is the mandatory stock
 * 8-keyframe table that {@link ensure24h} expands.
 *
 * `timecyc24h.dat` is the name the `timecyc24h.asi` plugin (Dante) reads on the `sa` target; the file it
 * expects is the same 27-column, 23 × 24, 52-number schema as `timecyc_24h.dat` — the two 24h plugins in
 * this project differ only in the file name each one hardcodes, which is why swapping their data files in
 * the real game silently leaves the stock table live. Nothing here needs to tell the two apart at parse
 * time; `kind` exists so a reader can SAY which file won.
