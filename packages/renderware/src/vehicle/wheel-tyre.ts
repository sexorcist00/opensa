/**
 * Which materials of a WHEEL are the tyre (plan 084).
 *
 * Rubber does not reflect, and SA says so where it can: its own wheels carry an env map with a coefficient
 * of 0, the "not reflective" marker. Mods do not — their exporter stamps the reflection plugin on every
 * material it writes — so a modded car drove around with glinting tyres while its rim, which SHOULD carry a
 * reflection, was indistinguishable to us. The rim keeps its own reflection; only the tyre is silenced.
 *
 * The signal is GEOMETRY, never a texture name (`tire`, `tyre`, `tread`, `wheel`, `generic_tire_01`,
 * `vehicletyres128` — the field set already disagrees with itself). A wheel is a disc about its axle, and
 * the tyre is the outer BAND of it: measured across stock and mod cars, tyre materials sit at a mean radius
 * of 0.87-0.98 of the wheel's own maximum while every rim material sits at 0.18-0.70. Nothing lands between.
 *
 * A car may simply have no tyre — one material over the whole wheel, a tank track, a model with no wheel
 * atomic at all — and then this returns an empty set and nothing is silenced.
