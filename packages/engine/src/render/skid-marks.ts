/**
 * Skid-mark decals (plan 089/03) — the engine's first (and only) decal lane. A mark is not a particle: it
 * is world GEOMETRY lying on the road, a ribbon of quads extruded along a tyre's contact path, textured
 * with SA's own `particleskid` and fading out on the WALL clock (the brief's 5 REAL seconds — a game hour
 * is 60 real seconds here, so a game-time fade would run ~7× too fast; the shader reads the engine-uptime
 * seconds the frame uniform already carries).
 *
 * The store is a RING of segments — the brief's "oldest recycled first" is the write cursor wrapping. The
 * live window [start, end) advances past expired segments each frame (expiry is FIFO because birth is
 * monotonic), so dead quads are never rasterised; the window crosses the wrap as at most TWO draw ranges.
 * GPU side is the corona pattern: one buffer sized to the cap at install, small positional writeBuffers
 * for freshly laid segments only, nothing created per frame.
