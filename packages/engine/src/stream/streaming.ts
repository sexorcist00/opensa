/**
 * Thin streaming driver (plan 074/05): plan-060 semantics re-implemented three-free — rings + hysteresis,
 * keep-old-level-until-replacement, atomic HD↔LOD swap, bounded creates (≤1 cell/frame), eviction outside the
 * outer ring. Cells come from the pak worker as transferable blobs.
 *
 * Textures stream WITH the cells (003 phase 4): each cell entry lists the arrays it draws with, so an array
 * is fetched alongside the first cell that needs it and destroyed when the last such cell unloads. Before
 * that the whole district's arrays had to be resident from boot (~1.7 GB on a full map), because nothing
 * knew which cell wanted which. A pre-`textures` pak still loads eagerly in `setup`.
 *
 * The LOD ring is the fog-mask boundary (plan 074/21): hosts size it via `lodRadius` so that
 * `fogCut + margin ≤ lodRadius`, and the LOD/evict decisions test the closest point of the cell's TRUE
 * geometry AABB (manifest `aabb`, plan 087) — an instance welds into the cell of its PIVOT, so meshes
 * (bridges, piers) reach a mean 141 u / max 799 u past the grid rect on gostown, and a grid-rect ring
 * skipped cells whose geometry already sat inside the fog. Pre-`aabb` paks fall back to the grid rect
 * (whose closest-point test already beat the old centre test by the 177 u half-diagonal).
