/**
 * Baked cell collision, read out of the pak (plan 097/3-01, the runtime half).
 *
 * The bake put the COL parse in the converter; this is what makes the runtime stop doing it. The bytes ride
 * the SAME pak worker the cells do — one file handle, one range reader, no second fetch path — and a read is
 * a promise the collision streamer already awaits, so the parse the main thread used to pay 9.6–78.3 ms per
 * cell for becomes a range read in the worker plus a decode in a continuation.
 *
 * **The grid is the trap.** These entries are keyed on the GAME grid (`collisionCellSize`, 256), not on the
 * render grid (`cellSize`, 250) — two tessellations of one world. A caller streaming on the wrong one gets a
 * NEIGHBOURING cell's colliders rather than none, and the field reads that as a physics bug, so
 * {@link PakCollisionSource.cellSize} is published for the consumer to check against its own
 * (`docs/restrictions/architecture.md`).
 *
 * A miss is not an error: a cell with no collision, a pak built without `--bake-collision`, and a failed read
 * all answer `null`, and the caller falls back to parsing COL exactly as it always did.
