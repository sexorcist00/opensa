/**
 * Vehicle lamps, renderer-agnostic (plan 074/08 B5 step 5). The three path's `VehicleHeadlightSystem` keeps

 * light pool and its existing corona pass without a second copy of the lore.
 *
 * The three parts of a lit car, all from the shared {@link lampStateFor} / {@link lampsOf}:
 *   - the LAMPS themselves (texture twin + glow) → the handle;
 *   - the POOL lights that pool on the asphalt ahead and glow red behind → `light` sink;
 *   - the CORONAS at each lamp, faded by how much the lamp faces the camera → `corona` sink.
