/**
 * Surface-driven wheel effects (plan 089/05): WHAT the driven car's wheels are running over, turned into
 * spawn requests — dust off a dirt road, sand off a beach, spray off a ford. The dispatch mirrors the
 * original's `CVehicle::AddWheelDirtAndWater`: the surface's `W_*` flags (surfinfo.dat, read since 081/10)
 * choose the effect class; the class → look mapping lives in the host's sink.
 *
 * Unlike the tyre smoke, these fire from plain ROLLING too — a dirt road dusts at speed with no slide at
 * all (that is what sells the surface change) — and a slide on the same surface throws more. Both fold
 * into one drive term; the thresholds are an eye-fit (`CFx::AddWheel*` are stubs in gta-reversed),
 * recorded in `docs/hacks/surface-fx-fit.md`.
 *
 * Cost note: this reads `readVehicleWheelSurfaces` every fixed step for the DRIVEN car — one short ray per
 * contacting wheel, priced in 081/07 §3 as the same order as the whole controller update. It stays on the
 * driven car for exactly that reason (the readme's budget: the player's car is the target).
