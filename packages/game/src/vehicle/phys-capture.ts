/**
 * What a scripted lap REPORTS (plan 081/01) — the `[phys]` capture's numbers, derived from the frames.
 *
 * The summary exists so a ledger row can be read without replaying anything: the peak nose-up angle while the
 * brakes were on, the roll a slalom reached, whether the car ever went over, how long it was in the air. Every
 * later 081 plan is judged by moving these numbers, so they are computed once, here, and the same function
 * runs over a BEFORE capture and an AFTER one.
 *
 * The peaks are taken over EVERY frame while the series a capture prints is thinned — a spike must survive
 * the thinning as a number even when its sample is dropped from the curve.
