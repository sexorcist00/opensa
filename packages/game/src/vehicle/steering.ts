/**
 * How much of its lock a car may actually use — the original's own speed-sensitive steering limiter.
 *
 * `CAutomobile::ProcessControl` (gta-reversed, `docs/links.md`) does this to the player's car every step:
 *
 * ```cpp
 * steerAngle = adhesive * traction * 4.0f * 4.0f / (speedForward * speedForward);
 * steerAngle = std::min(steerAngle, 1.0f);
 * steerAngle = std::asin(steerAngle) / DegreesToRadians(m_fSteeringLock);
 * // …forced back to 1.0 when countersteering a slide, or with the handbrake up
 * m_fSteerAngle *= steerAngle;
 * ```
 *
 * Read it as physics rather than as a tuning curve: a tyre can hold `μ × g` of lateral acceleration, a turn
 * at speed `v` and radius `r` demands `v² / r`, so the tightest turn the tyres allow grows with the square of
 * speed — and the wheel angle that asks for exactly that is what the `asin` returns. **The car is prevented
 * from asking for more grip than it has.** That is the difference between a car and a cursor: without it,
 * full lock at 100 km/h is a request the tyres answer by letting go, which is the "the car just snaps round"
 * complaint in one line.
 *
 * Two exemptions, both the original's and both important: **countersteering** (steering into a slide the car
 * is already in) gets the full lock back, because that is how a driver saves it; so does the **handbrake**,
 * because a handbrake turn is a deliberate slide.
 *
 * It replaces two fitted constants — a flat 0.6 of the authored lock and a 0.6 falloff toward top speed —
 * neither of which knew anything about grip.

 * Surface adhesion — a tyre on tarmac, straight out of the game's own data.
 *
 * `g_surfaceInfos.GetAdhesiveLimit` reads `data/surface.dat`, a 6×6 matrix of adhesion GROUPS, and
 * `data/surfinfo.dat` says which group each surface belongs to. Both files ship in the build and both are
 * unambiguous: `WHEELBASE` (the surface the tyres are, per surface.dat's own header note) is in group
 * `RUBBER`, `TARMAC` is in group `ROAD`, and the Road×Rubber cell is **4.5**.
 *
 * It was **1.0** here for one build, because it was guessed rather than looked up — and since the limiter
 * divides by the square of speed, guessing it 4.5× low left a car with 4.5× less steering than the original
 * gives it. The field caught it immediately ("still hard to turn in at speed"). At 4.5 the limiter allows the
 * FULL authored lock below about 65 km/h and 9.4° of a 35° lock at 100 km/h.
 *
 * **Now a fallback, not the answer** (081/10 step 5): the caller passes the adhesion its front wheels are
 * actually standing on, read from `surface.dat` through the surface under each wheel. This constant is what
 * a world without those files gets — and it is the same 4.5, so nothing moves when they are missing.

 * shipped as 0.05 in m/s: 50× too sensitive, so the ORDINARY outward body slip of any corner at speed
 * (~0.5–1.5 m/s at 1–3° of slip) tripped the exemption within ~0.1 s and handed the driver FULL LOCK — the
 * limiter was effectively disabled in every real corner. A full keyboard press at 100+ km/h then buried the
 * front wheels at 30° (3–6× past saturation, with the `fTractionLoss` penalty and the scrub drag of a
 * near-sideways tyre): the "barely steers at speed" plow that survived a 7× grip range, a 2× gravity change
 * and the 081/09 assist — none of which could matter while the front was drowned in its own steering angle.
 * The same unit-class bug as `ROAD_ADHESION = 1` and the `×0.001` before it; found by the `sweeper` capture
 * showing `steer` at the FULL granted lock 0.2 s into a 1°-slip corner (081/09 ledger, 2026-07-27).
