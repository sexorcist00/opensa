/**
 * Tyre smoke (plan 089/02): WHERE and HOW HARD the driven car's tyres slide, turned into spawn requests
 * for the dynamic particle lane (089/01). No new physics — everything here is a READ of what the physics
 * layer already decided this step.
 *
 * WHY not the telemetry slip ratio: Rapier's wheel ROTATION is cosmetic — it follows the ground exactly
 * (measured: 0.05 m/s of "slide" during a −1.1 g full-brake stop), so a rotation-derived ratio can never
 * see a lockup or a burnout. The honest longitudinal signal is DEMAND OVER CAP, recorded by
 * `setVehicleControls` at the only moment both are known ({@link VehicleWheelSlip}): brake demand past the
 * tyre = SA's locked wheel, engine force past the tyre = wheelspin. The lateral half needs no inference —
 * `planarMotion.speedLateral` IS the slide velocity.
 *
 * The three channels reduce to one EQUIVALENT SLIDE SPEED (m/s) per wheel:
 * - lateral: |speedLateral| — the patch slides sideways at the body's lateral speed;
 * - locked (brakeExcess): the patch slides at the car's ground speed, scaled in by how far past the cap
 *   the demand went;
 * - wheelspin (spinExcess): the tread's overspeed is not recoverable from Rapier, so the surplus ratio is
 *   mapped through {@link SPIN_TO_SLIDE} — an eye-fit, like every constant here (SA's `CFx::AddWheel*`
 *   bodies are stubs in gta-reversed; recorded in `docs/hacks/tyre-smoke-intensity-fit.md`).
 *
 * DELIBERATELY off the telemetry sampler: `VehicleTelemetry.enabled` is the F2-tab/capture gate, and smoke
 * that only appears while the debugger is open would be a bug shaped like a feature.
