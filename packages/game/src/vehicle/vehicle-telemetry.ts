/**
 * Vehicle telemetry (plan 081/01): the instrument every later 081 plan tunes against, and the slip/speed
 * channel plan 080/05 (camera drift framing) consumes.
 *
 * Nothing here touches physics. The step's RAW readings come in as plain data ({@link VehicleSample} — the
 * caller reads them off the body and the raycast controller), the math is pure, and the result is one
 * {@link TelemetryFrame} per fixed step. That is what makes a baseline reproducible: the same sample sequence
 * always produces the same frames, in a unit test as in a scripted drive.
 *
 * Conventions, all GTA space (Z up, cars face +Y, +X is the car's right):
 * - **pitch** is positive NOSE UP. The chain's braking complaint ("the nose lifts instead of diving") is a
 *   sign on this channel, which is why it is the one number the baseline ledger must show.
 * - **roll** is positive with the RIGHT side down.
 * - **slip angle** is positive when the tail slides so the car points LEFT of where it travels.
 * - **g** is net acceleration (Δv/dt) in the body frame, in g. Gravity is NOT added: a car resting on its
 *   springs reads 0 vertical, a car in free fall reads −1.
