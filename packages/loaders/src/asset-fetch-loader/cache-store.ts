/**
 * Thin Cache Storage wrapper: the loader caches each RAW zip chunk as a Response keyed by its URL, so a
 * returning visit (or a retry after a blip) reads it back instead of re-downloading. Browser-only API —
 * exercised on the Playwright e2e lane, not in node units.
 *
 * The Cache Storage API needs a **secure context** (https / localhost) — it is absent over plain `http://`
 * (e.g. a phone hitting a LAN IP), where `caches` is not even defined. So every method degrades to a no-op
 * when it is unavailable: nothing is cached and the loader simply re-downloads each visit (see `available`).
 * {@link cacheStorageStatus} is what lets the shell SAY that, instead of the load being quietly disposable.
