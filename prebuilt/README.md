# Prebuilt app (`opensa-webapp.tar.gz`)

A built copy of the web app, committed on purpose. It is here for **one** case: a device that can run the
converter but cannot run vite.

That case is real and measured — on an Android 10 / arm64 phone, rolldown's native binding is killed by SIGILL
the moment it loads, so neither `vite` nor `vite build` works there out of the box
([edge-cases/browser-runtime.md](../docs/edge-cases/browser-runtime.md)). **A wasm fallback IS reachable since
2026-08-31** — five things have to be cleared in order, and the recipe is in
[development/termux.md](../docs/development/termux.md) — but it is five manual patches inside `node_modules`
that no reinstall survives, and it has only been proven for `vitest`, not for `vite` itself. So this archive
stays the answer for SERVING the app. The converter and the static server
are untouched by it (tsx/esbuild run fine), so the only missing piece is the app itself — and an app is just
static files.

## Use it

```bash
mkdir -p build/webapp && tar -xzf prebuilt/opensa-webapp.tar.gz -C build/webapp
npm run phone      # sees build/webapp/index.html and skips vite entirely
```

`phone.sh` then serves the app and the pak from the SAME static origin, so there is no CORS, no second port
and no dev server.

## Re-unpack it after every pull that touched the engine

`git pull` updates the ARCHIVE. It does not update `build/webapp`, which is the unpacked copy and is
gitignored — so a device that pulls a fix and does not extract keeps running the old app, and the symptom is
the bug still happening after it was fixed.

```bash
rm -rf build/webapp/assets      # NOT `rm -rf build/webapp` — that path is often a symlink to shared storage
tar -xzf prebuilt/opensa-webapp.tar.gz -C build/webapp
```

**The phone panel checks this and offers the same two commands as a button** — the served pages are compared
against the archive's by CONTENT, because a timestamp comparison always says "stale" here (`tar -x` restores
the times inside the archive, which are older than the archive file a pull just wrote):
[`tools-debug/phone-console`](../tools-debug/phone-console/README.md).

**Clear `assets/` rather than extracting over it.** Chunk filenames carry a content hash, so an overlay leaves
every old chunk in place beside the new ones. They are never loaded — `index.html` names the new hashes — but
they are indistinguishable from live files when something is being diagnosed by grep, and on 2026-08-12 that
cost a round of confusion: a search for the old error text found it in an orphan chunk minutes after the fix
had, in fact, arrived correctly.

## Rebuild it

**Anywhere except the phone.** `npm run build` is `tsc -b && vite build`, so refreshing this archive on the
device it exists for is a contradiction: vite is the thing that cannot run there. It looks like a hang rather
than an error — `tsc -b` over the monorepo grinds for minutes on phone-scale RAM, and rolldown's SIGILL kills
the process without printing a line. Build it on a machine that can, commit the archive, and let the phone
`git pull`.

```bash
npm run build -- --base=./
tar -czf prebuilt/opensa-webapp.tar.gz -C dist .
```

**`--base=./` is not optional**: without it the asset paths are absolute (`/assets/…`) and every one of them
404s when the app is served from a subfolder.

## What this costs, and when to delete it

A binary in git is permanent — every refresh adds another ~1.4 MB to the history that no later commit can
remove. So it is refreshed **rarely and deliberately** (a phone run needs the app's behaviour, not the newest
commit), and it is stale by nature: it does not follow the source. If a device that cannot run vite stops
being a target, delete the folder and this file with it — nothing in the build or the test lanes reads them.
