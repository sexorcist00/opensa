/**
 * Reconstruct the real-asset test fixtures (`fixtures/original/`) from a clean, UNMODIFIED GTA San Andreas
 * install under `game-src/original` (default). These are Rockstar assets, so they are NOT committed
 * (`fixtures/original/` is gitignored) — every contributor regenerates them locally on setup, or after
 * changing the manifest:
 *
 *   npm run test:fixtures
 *
 * Custom, non-Rockstar fixtures (`fixtures/custom/`) are a MIRROR of `fixtures-src/` — the curated,
 * version-pinned, mod-derived and golden-snapshot files that have no other source (30 of 37 exist
 * nowhere else on disk: locked models, petro, Shrek, proper-fixes, txds, the cleo trace/listing
 * snapshots). Since 2026-08-17 (the user's call) NOTHING under `tests/` is committed and neither is
 * `fixtures-src/`: it lives locally and is backed up by hand; this script wipes `fixtures/custom/` and
 * copies it in FIRST, then the manifests run. A tree without `fixtures-src/` gets no custom fixtures
 * and the tests that need them skip (`skipIf(!existsSync)`) — loudly, in the summary below.
 * A `committed` fixture READS from `fixtures-src/` (a corpus subject whose mod folder no longer
 * ships it keeps its pristine copy there, so the corpus survives that folder changing under it).
 *
 * Each fixture declares how it is produced:
 *   - copy:    copied verbatim from `game-src/<game>/<from>`
 *   - extract: extracted by name from a `models/*.img` archive
 *   - archive: a one-file stock VER2 `.img` built around an extracted entry
 *   - mod:     copied from `mods-src/original/mods/<from>` — opensa-pack's production input is a MODDED game, and
 *              the mods carry things the stock game barely has (95 % of their textures ship a mip chain)
 *
 * Extend MANIFEST when a test needs a new real-asset fixture, or MOD_MANIFEST when it needs a modded one.
 *
 * `data/timecyc_24h.dat` is generated here (the stock 24h expansion of timecyc.dat, no mod overlay).
 * Curated / version-pinned test models that can't be reproduced from a stock copy live under
 * `fixtures-src/proper-fixes-models/` (mirrored to `fixtures/custom/`) instead.

 *   `vehicles/` became `models/` + `new/` (vehicle-installer plan 007), so every layer is searched.
