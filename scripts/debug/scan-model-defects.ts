/**
 * scan-model-defects — rank every PLACED world model by broken-authored-vertex-data criteria
 * (map-optimizer plan 024 phase 1). Scans the SOURCE assets the build consumes (last mod wins,
 * vanilla otherwise — the same resolution `model-repack.ts` uses), so a hit names the mod that
 * shipped the defect. Criteria (extension point — add rows as new defect families appear):
 *
 *   Family A — authored normals facing DARKER than their faces (`lae2_roads17`): faces referencing
 *     a vertex normal whose up-component sits `--dz` (default 0.5) below the face normal's. See
 *     `analyzeNormals` for why the test is asymmetric (up-rotated normals are a legal authoring
 *     trick; only ground-rotated ones read as dirt/wedges).
 *   Family B — authored day-prelit black holes (`sphinx01_lvs`): vertices with day luma < 10 and
 *     whole-black triangles on models whose day median is healthy (≥ 40 — by-design dark models and
 *     `tobj` timed models are excluded; dark-at-night is design, plan 019).
 *
 *   Family C — UV mappings stretched far off square (`road_lawn34`, `sbseabed3_las20`, plan 025): faces
 *     whose UV→world map draws a texel `--aniso` (default 8) times longer than wide, up to a collapsed
 *     axis where a single texel row is smeared across the face, AND whose crushed axis is `--discont`
 *     (default 4) times finer than the model's own healthy median. Ranked by the SHARE of the model's own
 *     surface the flagged faces cover, and printed with the map-wide POPULATION, because how many models
 *     carry it is what decides curated list vs general rule. Original-game data — the optimizer moves no
 *     UV (025 phase 0), so a hit here is R*'s, not ours.
 *     **THIS CRITERION IS NOT SETTLED — read plan 025 before trusting its ranking.** FOUR formulations
 *     have been measured and all four mis-rank: raw anisotropy puts cables first (a ribbon SHOULD map a
 *     texel off square); edge-neighbour disagreement under-detects a contiguous band (`sbseabed3_las20`
 *     scored 1 flagged face of 39 while the field calls a quarter of it wrong); and this one, the model
 *     baseline, catches the bands correctly but puts `wires_*` back on top, because a wire model also
 *     carries poles, so it HAS a healthy baseline its strands deviate from; and `--up`, which keeps only
 *     up-facing faces after the field labelled `road03sfn` CLEAN (its 40% was the invisible SKIRT under the
 *     road), yet still ranks that clean model 4x above the broken `road_lawn34`. Geometry alone has not
 *     told "stretched by design" from "stretched by mistake". Use it to SIZE the population, not to
 *     conclude a model is broken. The reason none of the five works is now measured and is about the METHOD:
 *     `road03sfn` carries 42 UP-FACING collapsed faces over 21 % of its visible area and the field calls it
 *     fine, because neighbouring buildings STAND on them. Visibility is a property of the assembled world,
 *     not of the model, so a model-local criterion cannot separate this class at all.
 *     FIRST world-context gate (2026-08-11, branch `025-world-visibility`): a face whose every corner sits
 *     `--water-depth` under the sea, judged in WORLD space through the instance transform, is dropped —
 *     `sbseabed3_las20` leaves the ranking entirely on it. Geometry occlusion is the half still missing.
 *
 * Run: npx tsx scripts/debug/scan-model-defects.ts [--game original] [--top 10] [--dz 0.5] [--aniso 8]
 *      [--discont 4] [--up 0.5] [--water-depth 0] [--json <out.json>]
 * Output per hit: metrics, source mod, instance count + a position — paste into
 *   `npx tsx scripts/debug/teleport-spot.ts <model>` for a field spot.

 * world units per UV unit along the map's principal axes. `σmax/σmin` is how many times longer than wide a
 * texel is drawn there — the smear the field sees.
 *
 * **But magnitude alone does not separate a defect from a look, and the first map-wide run proved it** (plan
 * 025 phase 1): ranking by raw anisotropy put `cables` and `wires_01..18_sfs` at the top with 100 % of their
 * surface flagged, because that IS how you texture a wire. A long thin ribbon should map a texel far off
 * square. Same failure 024 round 1 recorded when `standard01_lawn` topped a naive angle metric with a legal
 * vegetation trick.
 *
 * What separates `road_lawn34` from a cable is that the cable is stretched UNIFORMLY end to end, while the
 * road is a slab whose faces mostly agree and a band of which does not. So a face is flagged only when it is
 * BOTH stretched past `limit` AND its crushed axis is `discont`× finer than the median of its edge-neighbours'
 * — a discontinuity in the mapping, which is what reads as damage against its own surface. A face with no
 * neighbour is never flagged: with nothing to disagree with, there is no evidence either way.
 *
 * Area-weighted, for the reason Family A had to be: a count ranks slivers above the road slabs anyone looks at.
