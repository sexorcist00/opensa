# creation and the encode itself:
#
#   --astc-threads 0 → +4 workers (one per core)   2 → +2 workers   1 → +0, the encode runs on the MAIN thread
#
# 1 is the setting that spawns nothing, and it is the default because this phone died three times at
# `encoding texture arrays` while the flag was on the command line — the cap reached the model dictionaries
# and NOT the world arrays, whose encoder was built with no options at all and kept one worker per core. That
# was the whole bug (fixed 2026-08-09, `threads` is now required so a third call site cannot inherit a
# default). With it fixed the encode ran: 1.1 M texels in 12.8 s, single-threaded. The setting stays at 1
# because it is what has been proven on this device; the cost is speed only (astcenc's pool measured 2.38x one
# thread on 2026-08-07, bit-identical either way). `ASTC_THREADS=0` restores one-per-core for a machine that
# can afford it.
#
# WORTH RETRYING, and nobody has: the three deaths were caused by the bug FIXED on 2026-08-09, not by the
# thread count surviving it. `2` has not been tried since. The pool measured 2.38x one thread and is
# bit-identical, so it is a free 2x if the address space allows — pair it with a smaller HEAP (the isolates
# need room the 4096 MB reservation is holding) and a separate OUT, so a failed experiment costs nothing:
