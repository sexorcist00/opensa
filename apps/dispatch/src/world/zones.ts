/**
 * The world's named districts, as the console reads them (201/5-03).
 *
 * A dispatcher does not work in coordinates. "Grove Street, Ganton" is the address a call goes out with, and
 * until this existed the console's answer came from a **hardcoded table of twenty Los Santos landmarks** in
 * `ops/seed.ts` — which is fine for a demo of stock SA and wrong for every total conversion this engine
 * exists to run.
 *
 * **The console imports nothing from `packages/game` to do it**, and that is a decision rather than an
 * accident (201/5-03, recorded in `docs/restrictions/architecture.md`). The game's `ZoneNameSystem` is an
 * ECS system that tracks a PLAYER across frames; this surface has no player and no ECS, and needs one pure
 * question answered — what is at this point. That question lives beside the parser in
 * `@opensa/renderware` (`zoneAt`), where both consumers reach it and neither owns it.
 *
 * The DATA is baked: `districts.json` rides beside the pak with the GXT text already resolved, because
 * `info.zon` holds GXT keys and a surface streaming a pak has no `text/american.gxt` to resolve them
 * against. A pak without one — a total conversion with no `info.zon`, or a pak built before the field
 * existed — leaves the table empty, and the caller falls back to whatever it did before.
