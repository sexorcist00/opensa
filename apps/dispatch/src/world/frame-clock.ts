/**
 * What the console is allowed to say about its own frame rate.
 *
 * Since [201/4-01](../../../../docs/plans/201-dispatch-console/4-a-console-is-not-a-game/readme.md) the loop
 * wakes on a timer when nothing has changed and draws nothing (`IDLE_WAKE_MS`, 100 ms). So the interval
 * between two loop passes is not a frame time, and a mean over the last sixty of them is not a frame rate.
 * The readout was exactly that — `1000 / mean(dt)` over every pass, drawn or skipped — which reads **10 fps**
 * after a second of rest and then climbs back over the next sixty frames as the idle samples are pushed out
 * of the window. Every number in it was a real measurement; none of them described the frame the operator
 * was looking at, and a status bar that is wrong while the map is still is wrong exactly when it is read.
 *
 * So this counts what was DRAWN, and it separates the two questions a status bar answers:
 *
 * - **`fps` is a count**, never a reciprocal: how many frames were drawn in the last second. On a console
 *   that renders on demand this is genuinely low while nothing moves, and that is the truth — the frames
 *   were not drawn.
 * - **`frameMs` is the interval between two CONSECUTIVE drawn frames**, which is the only interval a frame
 *   time can be measured over. The one that follows a skipped wake spans the rest and is dropped rather
 *   than averaged in, and the median is reported rather than the mean so a single hitch does not move it.
 *
 * `cpuMs` is not here: the loop body's cost is measured directly in `boot.ts` and needs no window, and it
 * is the number that still means something when the map has drawn one frame in a second and there is no
 * interval to take at all.
