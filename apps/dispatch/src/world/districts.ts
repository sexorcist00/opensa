/**
 * The ground a 098 measurement may be taken on — and which of them is PINNED.
 *
 * [098/1-01](../../../../docs/plans/098-dispatch-console/1-the-map-profile/readme.md) pins one district for
 * the whole chain, because a before-table from one district and an after-table from another is not an A/B.
 * The first real mobile row was taken on Ganton — a valid measurement of a real district, and not part of
 * this chain's series, which cost a paragraph of prose in the benchmark file to say.
 *
 * So the name lives here rather than in three places that can disagree:
 *
 * - the console reads it for the opening pose, so `?district=` alone lands on the right ground;
 * - the inventory report reads it to say whether the capture belongs to the chain's series;
 * - `scripts/phone.sh` reads it for the pak rect, so the pak, the URL and the report all name one place.
 *
 * `cells` is an INCLUSIVE rect on the 250-unit render grid (cell = floor(worldXY / 250)) — the same form
 * `opensa-pack --rect` takes. A pak whose rect does not contain a district cannot show it, and that is the
 * failure this table exists to make impossible to take by accident.
