/**
 * The 201/1-01 inventory: what a map view actually costs per frame, measured before anything is cut.
 *
 * Two rules this collector exists to satisfy, both from the plan:
 *
 * - **It cuts nothing and changes nothing.** Its whole output is a before-table. A step that measured and
 *   tuned in one pass would have no baseline left to compare against.
 * - **It states what it could NOT measure.** On a phone there is no `timestamp-query`, so every GPU pass
 *   time is zero — not cheap, *absent*. A report that prints `gpuPassMs 0.0` beside real CPU numbers is a
 *   report that will be read six months later as "the GPU was free", which is the exact failure the mobile
 *   benchmark schema was written to prevent (200/1-02).
 *
 * Frame cost has three halves — the third one added after the first real capture, which is the point of it:
 *
 * 1. the engine's own per-frame stats (submit, GPU passes when the adapter can time them, draws, triangles,
 *    residency);
 * 2. the named spans for work that runs BETWEEN frames (`frameSpans`) — cell collider builds, `.osm` parses,
 *    texture uploads. The console never drained those before this mode existed;
 * 3. **the CPU side of the loop body itself.** The 2026-08-07 mobile row came back with `submitMs` at 5.6 %
 *    of a 31.8 ms frame, no `timestamp-query` on the adapter, and empty spans — so 94 % of the frame had no
 *    owner at all. A chain asked to cut what is never read cannot work against that, and the missing number
 *    is not a GPU one: it is how much of the frame the main thread was even running. That is measurable on
 *    any device, which is why it is here rather than waiting for a GPU timer no phone offers.
 *
 * The third half answers one question the mobile row left open and could not settle: **is the frame slow
 * because work is being done, or is it waiting?** A body of 6 ms inside a 32 ms frame says the main thread
 * is idle for 26 of them and the cost is downstream (present, GPU, vsync); a body of 28 ms says the opposite.
 * The two have opposite fixes, and the report now carries the split instead of the argument.
