/**
 * Which label gets the pixels (201/3-03): the decluttering rule for a screen with 150 units on it.
 *
 * At city zoom the console's symbology collides with itself — chips overlap chips, a callsign sits on top of
 * a call's code, and which one survives is whichever the loop drew last. That is not a drawing problem, it
 * is the label-conflict problem every map engine has solved, and the shape of the answer is
 * [MapLibre's](../../../../docs/links.md): rank the labels, walk them best-first, and give each one the
 * pixels only if nothing better has taken them.
 *
 * Three parts, and each answers one thing the step owes:
 *
 * - **Which label is asked for at all.** {@link unitWantsLabel} — the operator's call, 2026-09-05. Ranking
 *   150 names and then fitting as many as the pixels allow answers the wrong question: every one of them
 *   fought for the screen, and about thirty won it, which is a wall of text with a priority order inside it.
 * - **Which label wins.** {@link labelRank} — the operator's own priority, derived from the job rather than
 *   chosen: what they selected, then open calls worst-first, then the units committed to a call, then
 *   whatever is nearest the eye. Colour never carries it (`dataviz`), because the rank decides an ORDER and
 *   the colour already means a status.
 * - **What happens to the loser.** Its SYMBOL still draws — an icon is the datum and is never dropped — and
 *   only its name goes. The count comes back in `SymbologyCounts.chipsDropped` so the chrome can say how
 *   many names are hidden rather than letting the operator believe the map is complete.
 * - **The budget.** The rule above is the budget, and it is a property of the SHIFT rather than of the
 *   screen. {@link labelCeiling} is the viewport ceiling this module was written around — `floor(area /
 *   chipArea)`, one rule for a 360 px phone and a 4K desk — and it is NOT on the draw path: it never bound
 *   at any load the console has run (about seventy chips fit on this phone), which is exactly why the layer
 *   filled up. It is kept because it is the right shape for a screen that ever asks for more names than it
 *   has room for; today the collision index and the rule above settle it first.
 *
 * The index is grid-bucketed for the same reason MapLibre's is: at 150 units a naive all-pairs test is
 * ~11 000 comparisons a frame, and a 32 px grid turns each placement into a handful.
