/**
 * The console's per-operator storage: saved views (201/7-03), rebound keys (201/7-06) and where the operator
 * dragged their panels (201/7-08).
 *
 * One module rather than two copies of the same five lines, because the awkward half is identical for both
 * and getting it wrong is not a data bug: **touching `localStorage` THROWS** in private-mode Safari, in a
 * locked-down profile and when the quota is full, and an uncaught throw at module scope takes the whole
 * console down before a dispatcher sees anything. A surface that cannot remember a preference must still
 * boot and still work.
 *
 * The scope is honestly *this browser*: there is no account and no backend here yet. When the console
 * becomes a module of the CAD application ([202 phase 3](../../../../docs/plans/202-pcad-dispatch/readme.md)),
 * what a server round-trips is exactly what these keys hold.
