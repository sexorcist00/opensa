/**
 * Units as CARS (201/5-04): the model half of the symbology, under the chevron the 2D overlay draws.
 *
 * The decision this implements was taken on 2026-08-06 and is not a look choice — *cars and peds are drawn*,
 * because a dispatch map over a streamed world that replaces its units with icons has thrown away the one
 * thing it has that a tile stack does not. The symbol stays on top of the car (201/5-02): it carries the
 * callsign, the status colour and the priority, and it is what an operator picks out at city zoom. The model
 * is what makes the same board legible at street zoom.
 *
 * **Units are KINEMATIC, and that is the decision 201/1-03 was waiting for.** A unit's position is a CLAIM
 * the feed makes (202's first seam), not a simulation this surface runs: there is no physics here, no ECS
 * and no player, so a car is a root matrix written from the fix and nothing else. Nothing on this surface
 * reads collision — which is what lets the map profile drop the baked collision from its pak.
 *
 * **What happens when a model is absent is the step's real content**, because it is the normal case rather
 * than the error case: a pak deployed without its game dir, a build converted without `--vehicles`, a total
 * conversion that never had a car called `copcarls`, a feed that reports no model at all. Each one leaves
 * the unit exactly as 5/02 drew it — chevron, chip and beacon — says so ONCE in the log, and counts itself
 * into `?inventory=1`. A hole where a unit should be is the one outcome that is not allowed.
