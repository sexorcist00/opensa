 * `[x, z, −y]` from a GTA position, height verbatim. A map that places the same numbers half a metre off is
 * a map that disagrees with the game a dispatcher is looking at.
 *
 * The rotation is the same matrix as the handle's, restricted to yaw — a map has no roll or pitch to draw.
 * It is also where a car ends up facing backwards: a converted model is authored GTA Z-up with **+y
 * forward**, the engine is Y-up with `z = −y`, and the yaw therefore runs the OTHER WAY round than
 * {@link headingOf} reports it. Pinned by a test rather than by this paragraph — north must come out as
