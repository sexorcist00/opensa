 * The console's keyboard (201/7-06): what every command is, what it is bound to by default, and what this

 *
 * **One table, and it is the only one.** A key handled inline where it happens to be convenient is a key
 * that exists nowhere an operator can read, cannot be rebound, and silently collides with the next one
 * somebody adds — which is how a dispatch console ends up with three different meanings for `f` depending
 * on which panel has focus. Everything below is data: the input layer resolves an event against it, the help
 * sheet renders it, and the rebinder writes to it.
 *
 * **A key is a WORD, not a scancode.** `KeyboardEvent.key` is what the operator's layout says the key
 * produces, so a bound `q` is the key marked Q on their keyboard rather than the physical position of Q on
 * a US one. That is the right trade for a surface whose keys are mnemonics (`f` fit, `c` follow, `n` north)
 * and it is why the sheet can print what it prints.
