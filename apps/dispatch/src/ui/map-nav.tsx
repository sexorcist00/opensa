/**
 * The map's own controls (201/7-06): a compass that says which way north is and puts it back, plus zoom,
 * turn and tilt.
 *
 * Every one of them is a key as well, and that is the point rather than duplication: an operator on a phone
 * has no keyboard, an operator who has never read the key sheet has no keys, and a compass is the only thing
 * on screen that answers "which way am I facing" at all. They all go through the same handle methods the
 * keys go through, so the two cannot drift.
 *
 * The needle is an SVG rather than a glyph because it has to ROTATE with the view, and it is redrawn from
 * the readout — four times a second, off the frame path, like everything else in this tree.
 *
 * **The zoom LEVELS live here too, and that is the cross-platform rule rather than a layout preference**: on
 * a phone there is no `1`/`2`/`3` to press, so a capability that exists only on the keyboard exists only on
 * a desk ([restrictions/cross-platform-surface.md](../../../../docs/restrictions/cross-platform-surface.md)).
 * Every control grows to a finger's target size where the pointer is coarse, and stays dense where it is a
 * mouse — one component, two sizes, no second layout to keep in step.
