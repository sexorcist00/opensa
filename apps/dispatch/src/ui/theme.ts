/**
 * The console's skins, and the rule about what a skin is allowed to be.
 *
 * Asked for 2026-08-26 ("разные стили как у SonoranCAD"). SonoranCAD ships four operator-selectable themes
 * over one fixed screen, and it is the right idea executed in the expensive way: four hand-written skins,
 * one of which (`trevor`) fills a whole row with the status colour and drops its text contrast through the
 * floor. Four skins is four times the surface on which that can happen, and nothing there checks it.
 *
 * So a theme here is **data, not a fork**, and three things follow.
 *
 * **1. A theme is the INPUT to `styles.ts`, never a copy of it.** It carries the neutral ramp, the accent,
 * the two semantic surfaces, the shadows and a font stack — nothing else. Every one of them is emitted as a
 * CSS custom property, so switching a skin is one attribute on the app root: **no re-render, no restyle
 * pass through React**, which is the whole reason the colours left the TypeScript objects.
 *
 * **2. What a theme may NOT touch.** Target sizes (`TOUCH_TARGET` is not a taste), the layout, the dock,
 * and — the important one — **`map/beacons.ts` → `SET_COLORS`**. Those are the colours the engine draws
 * pillars with, and the lists, the radar, the labels and the header tallies all read the same table so a
 * chip cannot drift from the pin. A theme that repainted statuses would break exactly the agreement that
 * table exists to keep. (A colour-vision-safe status palette is a real and wanted thing, and it is NOT a
 * theme for this reason — see the note at the bottom of this file.)
 *
 * **3. A theme cannot ship with broken contrast.** `theme.test.ts` runs every preset through APCA and fails
 * the build below the thresholds `DESIGN.md` already declares — Lc 90 for primary text, Lc 60 for
 * secondary. That is what makes five skins cost less risk than SonoranCAD's four.

 * **Mark43** — the field preset, and the one that made the token contract grow (201/7-10).
 *
 * Read off the vendor's own product screenshot on 2026-08-28 (`Mark43CAD.pdf` page 2, 1071x549), because
 * the best-designed CAD in the surveyed field turned out to be this console's own direction arrived at
 * independently: square, opaque, ornament-free, and dark. Two things make it a different skin rather than a
 * recolour of Night, and both are structural:
 *
 * **1. The ramp is ACHROMATIC and it starts much lighter.** R, G and B within a couple of levels on every
 * step, against Night's cool slate at hue ~213; the ground is `#1e1f21` — 18.9 % of every pixel on their
 * screen — where Night's is `#070a0f`.
 *
 * **2. Depth is a LINE, not a value step and a shadow.** Ground to panel is about 10/255 on their screen and
 * there is no shadow anywhere; the `#333` separator does the work our layering and `shadow.float` do. That
 * is `shape.edge: 'line'`, and it is the layer a palette could not carry before this preset existed.
 *
 * **What is measured and what is fitted, stated because the difference matters.** The ground, the panel and
 * the separator are the source's own values, sampled from flat regions. The steps between them are FITTED:
 * a literal luminance sort of their swatches is not monotone — their grid rows measure below their ground —
 * and our layering rule is, so the ramp continues the measured span instead of copying an ordering our
 * roles cannot express. **The text is fitted and not sampled at all**, per the step's own procedure: text in
 * a resampled JPEG is blended with what is under it, and the source's contrast is not evidence that it
 * passes. Both steps were walked until `theme.test.ts` cleared its thresholds with margin — which is where
 * a borrowed palette becomes ours, and it is not a formality: **Night's own danger pink measures Lc 58 on
 * this preset's lighter surface**, under the floor it clears comfortably on Night.
 *
 * Its status colours are NOT here. Mark43 encodes state with 11 saturated hues on filled pills; ours come
 * from `SET_COLORS` in every preset, and 11 hues fails the read-by-more-than-colour rule the queue meets in
 * three channels.
