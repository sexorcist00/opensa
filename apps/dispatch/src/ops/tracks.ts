/**
 * The time axis (201/8-01): a unit's position stops being a point and becomes a **function of time**.
 *
 * A unit whose position is a point cannot be scrubbed. A unit whose position is a track can be, and
 * everything above it — smooth movement between server packets, trails, replay of a shift — falls out of the
 * same structure. This is the shape CZML gives Cesium; we take the idea (properties over an interval, driven
 * by a clock), not the format.
 *
 * **Where it lives, and why not on `Unit` as the plan first sketched it.** `Operations` is an immutable
 * snapshot and `stepOperations` is a pure reducer — the property that lets the whole board be unit-tested
 * and later swapped for a socket handler. A ring buffer cannot be immutable at a per-tick cost, so putting
 * one on `Unit` would either destroy that purity or copy 150 buffers 20 times a second. So the tracks are a
 * STORE the host owns beside the board, fed from the same tick, with exactly one writer. `Unit.at` stays
 * what it always was — the state at `ops.now` — and the store answers every other T.
 *
 * **What it records and what it drops** is the sampling policy 8/01 owes, and all three rules exist because
 * of the feed rather than by taste:
 *
 * - **Rate limit.** The feed publishes every 500 ms since 2026-09-05 (it was 4 s, see
 *   {@link PUBLISH_INTERVAL_MS}). Recording at the feed's rate would make the ring follow it — a memory
 *   figure that grows every time the feed gets better — so one sample per {@link RECORD_INTERVAL_MS},
 *   whatever is driving and however fast it arrives. **The 8x gap between the two rates is now real rather
 *   than theoretical**, which is what made `fixAge` necessary: the newest SAMPLE and the newest FIX stopped
 *   being the same thing.
 * - **A status change always samples**, rate limit or not: a unit that went en-route and arrived between two
 *   position samples has a history that says it never did.
 * - **A stationary run collapses to its two ends.** Most of a shift, most units are parked. Keeping the
 *   first and last sample of a still period says exactly as much as keeping four hundred of them.
 *
 * **What it does BETWEEN two samples is nothing, and that is the user's call (2026-08-22).** A track answers
 * with the last fix at or before the moment asked for — a step, not a slide. The plan's 8/02 was written
 * around interpolating between packets; interpolation was dropped before anything needed it, and the reasons
 * hold either way:
 *
 * - At the 4 s rate this was written against, a car at 100 km/h covered ~110 m between fixes, so a
 *   straight-line slide drew it gliding through buildings — smooth, confident and wrong, which 202 §4 named
 *   as the map's hardest constraint. A dot that jumps to where the unit was actually reported is the honest
 *   picture, and the cheapest fix for the jumping is the publish rate itself (202 phase 4) — **which is the
 *   answer that was taken on 2026-09-05**: at 500 ms the same car moves ~14 m, so the step this rule insists
 *   on is a step the eye no longer reads as a jump. Interpolation stays refused, and now has to justify
 *   itself against a gap eight times smaller.
 * - Nothing on screen needed it. The mock feed integrates at 20 Hz, so the live map is already smooth; and a
 *   drag across an 8 h timeline moves about one sample per pixel, so a slide inside a 4 s gap is invisible.
 *
 * It is a decision rather than an absence, so it is written down with what would bring it back: a field
 * verdict that stepping reads badly at a publish rate nobody managed to raise.
 *
 * The interval past the last sample is likewise NOT extrapolated — {@link UnitTracks.at} holds the last
 * known state and marks it stale, so that no consumer can invent a position.

 * 4 s, vehicles only ([202 §4](../../../../docs/plans/202-pcad-dispatch/readme.md)). 202's phase 4 lists
 * raising it as the cheapest of the three answers to a 4-second gap, and the user — who owns PCAD — has
 * taken it. So this is what the console is BUILT and MEASURED against, and the client change is owed on the
 * other side; the plugin's own rate stays recorded in 202 as what it publishes today.
 *
 * **2 Hz is the map's own ceiling, not a round number.** 202 §4 states it: this console draws on demand, and
 * a feed faster than about 2 Hz spends the frames render-on-demand exists to skip. Half a second is that
 * ceiling exactly — a car at 100 km/h moves ~14 m between fixes instead of ~110, which is the width of a
 * road rather than the length of a block, and the reason 8/02's *step, never slide* stops looking like a
 * jump.
 *
 * It is what a consumer measuring the feed's own behaviour reads: how long a fix may be old before it is
