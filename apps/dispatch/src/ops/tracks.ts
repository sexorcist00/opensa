/**
 * The time axis (201/8-01): a unit's position stops being a point and becomes a **function of time**.
 *
 * A unit whose position is a point cannot be scrubbed. A unit whose position is a track can be, and
 * everything above it — smooth movement between server packets, trails, replay of a shift — falls out of the
 * same structure. This is the shape CZML gives Cesium; we take the idea (properties over an interval, driven
 * by a clock), not the format.
 *
 * **Where it lives, and why not on `Unit` as the plan first sketched it.** `Operations` is an immutable
 * snapshot and `stepOperations` is a pure reducer — the property that lets the whole board be unit-tested
 * and later swapped for a socket handler. A ring buffer cannot be immutable at a per-tick cost, so putting
 * one on `Unit` would either destroy that purity or copy 150 buffers 20 times a second. So the tracks are a
 * STORE the host owns beside the board, fed from the same tick, with exactly one writer. `Unit.at` stays
 * what it always was — the state at `ops.now` — and the store answers every other T.
 *
 * **What it records and what it drops** is the sampling policy 8/01 owes, and all three rules exist because
 * of the feed rather than by taste:
 *
 * - **Rate limit.** The mock ticks at 20 Hz; PCAD publishes every 4 s (measured in its source, plan 202 §4).
 *   Recording at tick rate would make the mock's tracks five times denser than the live feed's — a memory
 *   figure that flatters, and a scrub that behaves differently in the two. So one sample per
 *   {@link SAMPLE_INTERVAL_MS}, whichever feed is driving.
 * - **A status change always samples**, rate limit or not: a unit that went en-route and arrived between two
 *   position samples has a history that says it never did.
 * - **A stationary run collapses to its two ends.** Most of a shift, most units are parked. Keeping the
 *   first and last sample of a still period says exactly as much as keeping four hundred of them.
 *
 * **What it does BETWEEN two samples is nothing, and that is the user's call (2026-08-22).** A track answers
 * with the last fix at or before the moment asked for — a step, not a slide. The plan's 8/02 was written
 * around interpolating between packets; interpolation was dropped before anything needed it, and the reasons
 * hold either way:
 *
 * - At PCAD's 4 s rate a car at 100 km/h covers ~110 m between fixes, so a straight-line slide draws it
 *   gliding through buildings — smooth, confident and wrong, which 202 §4 already named as the map's hardest
 *   constraint. A dot that jumps to where the unit was actually reported is the honest picture, and the
 *   cheapest fix for the jumping is PCAD's own publish rate (202 phase 4).
 * - Nothing on screen needed it. The mock feed integrates at 20 Hz, so the live map is already smooth; and a
 *   drag across an 8 h timeline moves about one sample per pixel, so a slide inside a 4 s gap is invisible.
 *
 * It is a decision rather than an absence, so it is written down with what would bring it back: a field
 * verdict that stepping reads badly at a publish rate nobody managed to raise.
 *
 * The interval past the last sample is likewise NOT extrapolated — {@link UnitTracks.at} holds the last
 * known state and marks it stale, so that no consumer can invent a position.
