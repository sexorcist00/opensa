/**
 * The embeddable build of the dispatch map (`src/embed.ts`).
 *
 * Separate from the root config on purpose: that one builds this repo's multi-page site, where `dispatch.html`
 * is one entry among several. This one emits a LIBRARY — one ES module a host loads at runtime — and it is
 * the artifact an external console pins.
 *
 * Nothing is externalised. A host has no `@opensa/*` packages and no way to get them (they are private
 * workspace packages), so the bundle carries the engine, the streamer and the formats with it. That is the
 * whole point of shipping an artifact rather than a dependency.
 *
 * React is absent by construction, not by configuration: the surface is plain DOM and engine, and only the
 * console's own chrome (`app.tsx`, not exported here) is React. If a React import ever appears in this
 * bundle, something from the chrome has leaked into the surface.
 *
 * The pak worker stays a SEPARATE chunk here and must be served beside the entry, at the path the entry
 * names — an embedding host serves files anyway, so it costs nothing and keeps 31 kB out of every page that
 * loads the map. A host that genuinely cannot serve a second file passes `createPakWorker` to the boot and
 * carries it inline instead (201/2-02): still a worker, still off the main thread, just carried rather than
 * fetched. `vite.share.config.ts` is the build that does that.
