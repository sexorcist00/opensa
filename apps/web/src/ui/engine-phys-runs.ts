/**
 * Scripted physics laps (plan 081/01) — `?phys=<scene|all>&car=<model>`, the `[bench]` runner's twin.
 *
 * A lap teleports next to the spot, spawns the model, seats the player, lets the springs settle, then hands
 * the wheel to a {@link ScriptedDriveSource} timeline while the telemetry ring records every fixed step. What
 * comes out is one `[phys] {json}` line per lap — the protocol the headless harness collects and
 * `phys-compare` diffs.
 *
 * The DRIVING is the real thing (the timeline goes through the same `InputState` and the same `drive()` the
 * player uses); the getting-in is not. Three sweeps were lost to the walk-in cancelling itself on a stalled
 * path, so a lap seats the player directly — 081 tunes how a car drives, not how a ped opens a door.
 *
 * Everything outside the timed window (streaming settle, seating, the spring settle) happens with the
 * capture OFF, so a lap's frames are the drive and nothing else.
