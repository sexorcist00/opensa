/**
 * The bench settle gate (plan 102). Both negative cases replay the FIELD sequence that put the player under
 * the mesh for a whole sweep: the ring poll answers for the ring around the PREVIOUS anchor (already
 * drained), and nothing anywhere waits for collision. The scene under test is `ocean-horizon` on purpose —
 * it is the one whose anchor was moved onto the sand in 2026-07 to work this same class around
 * (78046648), and the only scene with no road cars, so the game fs is never touched.
 *
 * A race is only nondeterministic in the FIELD: here the frame clock and the collision promise are both
 * held in the test's hand, so "the collision lost the race" is a pinned ordering.
