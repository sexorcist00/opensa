/**
 * WebGPU boot gate (plan 074/10, WebGPU-first): the own engine IS the game, with no WebGL fallback.
 *
 * The probe asks ONE question — can this browser give us a device at all — and deliberately not a second.
 * It used to also demand `texture-compression-bc`, which conflated the DEVICE with the CONTENT: a phone
 * whose browser runs WebGPU perfectly well was told its browser does not support WebGPU, because the world
 * we happened to ship was BC. Whether a given world can be displayed is read from that world's manifest
 * instead (`requireWorldSupport`, at stream setup), where the answer is true and specific.
 *
 * What it reports is a REASON, not a boolean (plan 097/4-05). "No WebGPU in this browser" and "WebGPU is
 * here and the adapter was refused" are different facts with different remedies, and the phone case is the
 * second one: a Mali-G51 on Chromium 148 has WebGPU and returns a **null adapter** because of the driver
 * blocklist (`docs/edge-cases/browser-runtime.md`, 2026-08-04). Telling that user to "use a recent Chrome"
 * is false and unactionable — they are on one.
