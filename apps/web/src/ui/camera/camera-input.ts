/**
 * Look-input dampening (plan 080/02, behaviour #11): raw pointer deltas feel cheap because a flick lands as
 * one hard step. This spreads each flick over a few frames WITHOUT losing any of it.
 *
 * The distinction that matters: dampened ≠ laggy. Every pixel the player moved is eventually applied — the
 * pending pool only redistributes it in time — so the total rotation of a gesture equals the total mouse
 * travel exactly, as it does with raw input. `camera-input.test.ts` asserts that conservation.
