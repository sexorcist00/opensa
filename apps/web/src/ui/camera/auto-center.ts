/**
 * Auto-centering (plan 080/03, behaviours #1 and #6): the camera finding its way behind the player without
 * being asked. Two writers on the yaw, mutually exclusive, both beaten instantly by the mouse:
 *
 * - **turn-follow** (the 036 prod semantics, ported): a fast heading CHANGE swings the camera behind the new
 *   direction and then stops. Walking straight never engages it — a framing the player chose survives a whole
 *   straight run.
 * - **idle recenter** (the GTA V behaviour 036 lacked): after the look has been idle a while AND the player is
 *   actually moving, the yaw eases behind them at a speed-scaled rate. Standing still never recenters — a
 *   parked camera is left alone.
 *
 * Heading here is the GTA facing angle (`Locomotion.heading`: rate-limited and plant-aware on foot, the car's
 * own heading while seated) — NOT an atan2 of the velocity, which jitters at low speed and flips on a strafe.
