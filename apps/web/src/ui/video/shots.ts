/**
 * Video mode's shot presets and the framing math under them (plan 096/03).
 *
 * A shot is a TABLE ROW, never a code path: where the camera stands relative to the car, where the car sits
 * on screen, which lens, how long, how softly it follows. Three behaviours cover every row — `chase` yields
 * the frame back to the shipped follow rig, `tracking` rides the car's own heading frame, `static` plants the
 * eye once and lets the car drive past it.
 *
 * Two rules the numbers obey, both from CLAUDE.md and the 080 chain:
 *
 * - **Offsets are multiples of the CAR's own half-extents**, so a shot composed on the `admiral` frames a bus
 *   and a Bandito the same way. No metre is written against a model.
 * - **Offsets live in the SUBJECT's heading frame**, never the camera's screen frame — a screen-frame offset
 *   rotates while a swing is in flight and reads as a stick-and-jump (`docs/edge-cases/camera-rig.md`).
 *
 * Everything here is pure and engine Y-up: the caller converts at the physics boundary (the 080 two-spaces
 * rule) and hands over an already-converted subject.
