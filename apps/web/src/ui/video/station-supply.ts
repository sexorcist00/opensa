/**
 * The station supply (plan 096/04): the live half of the tripod survey — it watches the shot list for the
 * next tripod slot, surveys candidates against the REAL world a few casts at a time while the preceding shot
 * plays, and hands the director an eye the moment that shot cuts.
 *
 * Split from `stations.ts` on purpose: that file is pure (candidates, prediction, scoring against a probe
 * interface) and this one owns the wiring — when to start, what the budget is, and the two space conversions.
 * The director never sees GTA coordinates and never sees a cast.
