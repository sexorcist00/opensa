 * The scene's whole shot list is drawn UP FRONT from the seeded stream (D9 — `?seed=` reproduces the shot

 *
 * Two discontinuities exist by design, and both are DECLARED: the cut between shots, and the hand-over

 * middle, so this one is a CLOCK, not a gate — the car has to be out of the safe frame for
