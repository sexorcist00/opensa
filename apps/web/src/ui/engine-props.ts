/**
 * TOPPLED props on the own engine (074/08 B7·a): the lampposts, meters and posts SA knocks OVER rather than
 * shattering (object.dat gives them a non-zero uproot limit).
 *
 * The first attempt animated the fall analytically in the debris pass — one shard, pivoting on the base. It
 * looked wrong immediately: a pole has to fall away from the car that hit it, and then it has to LAND on
 * something. Both of those are physics, and we already run physics. So a toppled prop becomes a real dynamic
 * body: Rapier decides where it falls, what it hits and how it comes to rest, and the renderer just follows
 * the body. It is also why the fall direction needs no arithmetic here — the impulse carries it.
