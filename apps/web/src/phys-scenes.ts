/**
 * The scripted physics track (plan 081/01) — the `[bench]` scene list's twin for driving.
 *
 * Every spot is a REAL place on the road graph, not a coordinate from memory: the straights come from a scan
 * of the game's own `NODES*.DAT` vehicle nodes for chains that hold one heading with no height change, and
 * the crest from the same scan asking for a rise then a drop inside a launch length. Each scene records the
 * measured shape of its spot, because a scene whose ground turns out to be wrong invalidates every number
 * captured on it, and that has to be checkable later.
 *
 * Cars are ground-snapped at spawn (`seatVehicleOnGround`), so `position.z` is a hint. Headings are the
 * road's own heading from the graph (GTA convention: 0 faces +Y, counter-clockwise about +Z).

     * comet climbs it (z +40 cm) and drives on it, so a lap that is stopped by it here is being stopped by a
     * KERB. The nearest props are the traffic light at (2237.5, 1198.8) and the pillars at (2238.2, 1204),
     * ~18 m west — this is aimed at the clear span between them and the lamppost at (2253.6, 1189).
