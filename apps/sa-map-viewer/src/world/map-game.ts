/**
 * The `MapGame` the debugger's `MapInspector` drives (plan 094, phase 2). Implementing that one interface is
 * what buys the whole panel — the cell grid, the whole-map toggle, LOD mode, the selection block — without
 * copying a line of its UI.
 *
 * The inspector OWNS the cell set here, exactly as it does in the game: it seeds itself from `viewCell()` at
 * mount (so the viewer opens on the cell under the camera, which is what `?at` names) and every checkbox
 * writes through `setManualCells`. There is no camera-follow behind its back — two owners of one cell set is
 * how a debug tool starts lying about what it is showing.
 *
 * Picking (phase 3) rides the `.oscell` placement mapper (minor 6) the welder writes: a click becomes a cursor
 * ray, `CellStore.pick` slab-tests it against the mapper rows of every visible cell, and the hit goes out on
 * the `select` event the inspector's SELECTED block already listens to.
