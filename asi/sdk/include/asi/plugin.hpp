// The plugin surface: what a consumer supplies to the framework. The SDK owns the attach lifecycle, the exe
// gate, the byte-verify and the deferral plumbing; the plugin owns its identity, its generated tables and what
// its patches actually do. The framework may never include a payload header — this struct is the seam.
//
// A plugin defines ONE `constexpr Plugin` (see perfect-map's `src/plugin.hpp`) and hands it to
// `asi::OnAttach(...)` from its DllMain. Everything here is compile-time constant: no allocation, no
// registration, no CRT.
