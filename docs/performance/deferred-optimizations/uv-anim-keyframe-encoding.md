# Compress UV-animation keyframes in the `.osm` DESC

**Status:** in reserve — opened 2026-08-07 alongside the change it describes
([plan 099/01](../../plans/099-script-object-uv-anim/01-bake-the-animation-through.md)).

## What we do today

The rigid builder copies a model's referenced UVAnimDict entries into the `.osm` `DESC` **verbatim**: every
keyframe, every one of its six `uv` params, as JSON. The runtime walks that list with the same stepper the
world lane uses.

Measured on the asset the lane exists for, the Pacific Park ferris wheel's light ring:

| part of the file                | bytes       |
| ------------------------------- | ----------- |
| `ferriswheel_lights.osm` (built) | 3 981 140 B |
| its `DESC`                       | 20 512 B    |
| of which `uvAnimations`          | 19 312 B    |

So the animation is **94 % of that model's description** and **0.49 % of the file**. Nothing else in the
current corpus animates at all: every other `.osm` carries no key.

## The lever

`f13d` is a STEP animation — 261 keyframes that are really 13 distinct u-offsets, held 0.225 s each, over a
29.25 s loop. Written as (frame count, cadence, first offset, step) it is a few dozen bytes instead of
19 KB. A general form would keep the verbatim list only for animations that are genuinely irregular, and
recognise the two shapes SA actually ships (a stepped flipbook, a linear scroll).

## What it would win

~19 KB per animated model in the pak, and the same in decode work at spawn (`JSON.parse` over that array).
Against 4 MB of geometry for the one model that has it, that is noise **today**.

## What would have to be true to pull it

A corpus where animated models are common — a mod pack full of animated billboards or signs, or the class
growing past a handful of models. Then the number to beat is the DESC parse at spawn, not the disk bytes.

## Why we did not

The verbatim list is what the parser already produces and what the world lane already consumes; a compressed
form is a second encoding to keep honest, and the first thing it would break is an animation neither shape
describes. The cost is a fraction of a percent of one model in the whole game. **Recognising a shape is also
a claim about the data** — and the rule here is that our data is a mod author's, not the stock game's, so
that claim would need a corpus survey before it is worth making.
