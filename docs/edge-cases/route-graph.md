# Road graph and route builder (096) — edge cases

Current limitations of the drivable-route layer (`packages/game/src/paths/`, read by video mode). Read
alongside [`docs/features/video-mode.md`](../features/video-mode.md).

## A dense city GRID yields no route at all

The builder rejects a walk whose turns exceed 45° accumulated over any 25 m window (096/01, the constraint
that moved the tightest driven corner from 2.0 m to ~19 m). Downtown Los Santos is a right-angle grid whose
blocks are shorter than that window, so **every** walk out of it dies as `too-tight`.

Measured 2026-07-30 (096/04): pinning video mode to downtown LS (`?video=1&at=1450,-1500`) produced **0
accepted routes in 40 tries per scene, across 5 scenes** — the runner said so each time and fell back to a
seeded route elsewhere. The same pin one district over (`&at=847,-1772`, the hardest accepted LA start that
`scripts/debug/video-routes.ts --worst` prints) accepted immediately, every scene.

Consequences:

- **A pinned field round can silently be a run somewhere else.** The fallback is logged
  (`no route out of the pinned start in 40 tries`) — grep for it before believing a pinned capture.
- Video mode's Los Santos scenes are biased toward open, sweeping roads. That is the turn budget's doing,
  not the sequencer's, and loosening it is 05's variety knob (`maxWindowTurnDeg`).
- Anything that wants a route through a city grid — a walk scene, a curated route list — needs its own
  constraint set, not the drive-scene one. The constraints are already parameters
  (`RouteConstraints`), so this is a caller's decision and not a builder change.

## A predicted car position drifts with the car's own obedience to the route

The station survey (096/04) judges candidates against where the car is PREDICTED to be across a shot's
window, walked from the route's per-vertex target speeds. The autopilot is a follower of those speeds, not a
guarantee of them: 096/02 measured a 10.2 m/s mean against a 12 m/s cruise.

Measured 2026-07-30, over 12 taken stations: **median 1 m, worst 6.6 m** between the predicted window start
and where the car actually was. The mechanism behind every large one is the same — a window that still covers
part of the car pulling away. Two rounds got it there from 19.5 m: scaling the walk by the speed the car is
currently keeping, then not starting a survey until the car holds 80 % of its target (a launching car's speed
describes the launch). What remains unspent is the plan's own lever: resample the midpoint once at cut time.

Consequence: a surveyed station's sightline verdict is for a stretch of road offset by that much. It has cost
nothing so far (0 empty-frame cuts in 25 scenes) because the aim tracks the car live regardless — only the
CHOICE was made against the prediction.

## Travel DIRECTION is not expressible from the link table

The graph's links are 100 % mutual (096/01 measured: 0 links without a reverse edge over 30 587 vehicle
nodes), so a route may be walked the wrong way up a one-way street. SA keeps lane direction in the navi
nodes, which are not parsed. Nothing catches this — it needs a human watching the footage.

## The graph we parse carries VEHICLE nodes only — there is no pavement in it

`adapters/path-graph.ts` reads the vehicle half of `NODES*.DAT`. SA's ped nodes are in the same files and are
not parsed, so nothing in the engine knows where a pavement runs, where a crossing is, or which side of a
street a person may walk down.

The walk scene (096/07) therefore walks a DRIVING route offset 6.5 m to the right of the carriageway, and
that offset is the entire pavement model. Where a road has no pavement — a tunnel mouth, a freeway shoulder,
a desert verge — the walker is on dirt, against a wall, or heading for a drop.

What catches it: only the drop. Each waypoint inside the streamed collision ring is ground-probed and a miss
rejects the whole route (`video/walk.ts`). Furniture — benches, lampposts, building steps — passes every
check we have, and is **silent**: the ped's own capsule slides along it and the scene keeps playing.

The lift is small and known: parse the ped nodes. See `docs/hacks/pedestrian-route-on-a-vehicle-graph.md`.

## A route's per-vertex speeds are what the station survey predicts from — including for a WALKER

`walkRoute`'s `cruiseSpeed` writes the target speed at every vertex, and `predictAlong` walks those speeds to
decide where the subject will be during a shot. So a route built for a subject that does not travel at that
speed produces a prediction that is wrong by the ratio of the two.

Measured 2026-07-31 (096/07's first headless walk scene, seed 47 scene 8): a walk route left at the driving
default of 12 m/s while the ped walked at 2 predicted a 15 s tripod window covering ~180 m of pavement
instead of ~30, and **every one of the 8 candidates was rejected on dwell** — the tripod never filled, the
slot played its fallback, and 48 casts were spent finding that out. Passing the ped's own speed: 2 stations
filled, 0 rejected, 14 casts.

Nothing catches this in a test — the survey is behaving correctly on the numbers it was given. It shows up
only in a scene report's `stations.rejected.dwell`, which is why that field is in the ledger.
