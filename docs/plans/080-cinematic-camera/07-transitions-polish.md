# 080/07 — Transitions, polish, close-out

The chain's finishing plan: everything that needs ALL previous layers in place, plus the exit exam.

## 1. Mode transition audit

02–06 were built so transitions are implicit (shared channels, per-mode tuning tables, no state
resets). This plan proves it:

- Matrix walk: foot↔vehicle (05 blends), photo enter/exit (K+M seeds `flyEye` from the live eye —
  already smooth; verify the RETURN path re-seeds rig springs so leaving photo mode doesn't whip),
  debugger warps/respawn (teleport snap from 02), pause/F2.
- A scripted integration test drives one long snapshot sequence through every transition and
  asserts continuity (no frame-to-frame eye jump > a threshold except declared teleports).

## 2. Pitch-coupled framing (readme addition — polish)

- Looking down: look-point height eases up a touch and distance tightens (the character stays
  composed instead of centering on their back). Looking up: height eases down toward the
  shoulder. Small mapping (≤ 0.4 m, ≤ 1.0 m distance), through existing channels; one config
  curve. Skippable if the field round says the base rig already frames well.

## 3. Tuning consolidation

- Freeze the final tuning tables (foot + vehicle) in `game-runtime-config.ts`; every value that
  survived field rounds gets its ledger line moved into a single "shipped tuning" table here.
- Prune Camera-tab rows down to the knobs that proved useful during rounds (the rest stay
  config-only) — the tab is a tuning tool, not a settings screen.

## 4. Performance + regression exit exam

- Measure `director.update` p95 on foot / in traffic / in an interior (collision whiskers hot):
  budget < 0.1 ms, casts ≤ 5/frame — ledger with numbers.
- Ritual 6-scene bench sweep: fps/draws within noise of the pre-080 reference row (bench bypass
  invariant — this row is the proof the chain touched nothing it shouldn't).
- One soak leg (`?soak`) with the new camera live to confirm no drift/leak in rig state.

## 5. Close-out

- ~~Delete the `?cam=legacy` branch and the preserved pre-080 inline path~~ **DONE EARLY 2026-07-25**
  (the user accepted the rig as the default after 01–04, so the escape hatch had no job left). The flag,
  the `legacy` rig-state field and its five branches are gone; the parity test STAYED — it now steps a
  config with every smoothing channel zeroed, so the reduction to the pre-080 stick math is still pinned.
  `?cam` stays reserved for future camera debug if needed.
- `engine-camera.test.ts` and the director suite are the pinned behaviour record; docs sweep:
  this chain's ledgers complete, readme status flipped to DONE with the field-verdict quotes
  (paraphrased in English, per repo rule).
- Write the 0.6.0 idea stubs deferred from the readme: idle cinematic auto-camera, R-key
  cinematic vehicle camera, gamepad input path (camera-ready once input exists).
- Memory/handoff update (outside the repo): camera chain state + tuning gotchas.

## Subtasks

- [x] Transition matrix + continuity integration test.
- [x] Pitch-coupled framing — SKIPPED, deliberately (see the ledger).
- [x] Tuning freeze + tab prune.
- [x] Perf measurements + ritual sweep (ledger). The SOAK leg was not run — see the ledger for what was
      done instead and what that leaves owed.
- [x] Legacy-path deletion (early, 2026-07-25) — docs sweep + idea stubs still owed.

## Acceptance

- User plays a full mixed session (foot + car + interiors + photo mode) and accepts the camera as
  the default experience — the chain's real gate.
- Ritual row within noise; budgets in the ledger; suite green; `?cam=legacy` gone.

## Ledger

### 2026-07-25 — the transition exam, the tuning freeze, and one deliberate skip

**1. The transition matrix is now a test** (`ui/camera/camera-transitions.test.ts`). ONE snapshot sequence
walks the whole session — walk → climb in → drive a long corner → climb out → walk → map viewer (seeded
from the live eye) → overhead snap → hand the eye back → respawn — against one continuous rig.

The metric is the eye's motion RELATIVE to its focus (`|Δeye − Δfocus|`): absolute eye speed says nothing,
because a car at 24 u/s legitimately moves the eye 0.4 u per frame. Measured worst-per-leg, in world units
per frame:

| leg                | worst | |
| ------------------ | ----- | --- |
| walking            | 0.116 | the follow spring catching up |
| climbing in        | 0.529 | the steered swing behind the car — the fastest DELIBERATE channel |
| driving            | 0.752 | the corner swing + the distance curve |
| climbing out       | 0.775 | the swing behind the dismount |
| walking again      | 0.095 | |
| map viewer (enter) | 0.000 | seeded from the live eye — provably not a cut |
| overhead snap      | 0.000 | inside the leg; the snap itself is a DECLARED transition |
| back on foot       | 0.109 | the re-frame is declared; what matters is it does not then CRAWL home |
| respawn            | 0.116 | the teleport is declared; the rig snaps and carries on |

The bar is **1.0 u/frame**, set above the fastest deliberate channel (the swing, ~0.53) and below the
smallest cut this chain actually shipped and had to fix (the exit pull-in was metres). Three transitions are
DECLARED — the overhead snap, handing the eye back, and a respawn teleport — and only their first frame is
exempt; everything after it is held to the same bar, which is what proves there is no whip.

**2. Pitch-coupled framing: SKIPPED.** The plan itself made it skippable "if the field round says the base
rig already frames well", and four rounds said exactly that — every framing complaint that came back was
about MOTION (bob frequency, swing hitch, exit snap), never about how the character sits in frame while
looking up or down. Adding a height/distance coupling now would introduce a new channel with no reported
problem to solve, and would need its own round to clear. It stays in this doc as a one-line lever if a
later round ever asks for it.

**3. Tuning frozen + tab pruned.** The shipped table is below. The Camera tab lost three rows
(`landingDipFullSpeed`, `shakeImpactForce`, `vehicleFovLambda`) — reference points no round ever turned;
they stay config-only. 42 → 39 rows, and every survivor was moved by an actual field round.

#### Shipped tuning (frozen 2026-07-25, after four field rounds)

| channel | field | value | how it got there |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| input | `inputSmoothTime` | 0.03 | first guess, accepted untouched |
| look point | `positionLagTime` / `verticalLagTime` / `deadZone` | 0.12 / 0.28 / 0.08 | accepted; the dead-zone residual was explicitly kept |
| | `lagMaxDistance` / `teleportSnapDistance` | 1.2 / 20 | accepted |
| yaw | `yawLagTime` | 0.25 | accepted |
| zoom | `zoomLambda` | 8 | accepted |

| | `lookAheadDistance` / `lookAheadTime` | 0.8 / 0.45 | accepted |
| collision | `collisionRadius` / `collisionMinDistance` | 0.35 / 1.6 | round 1 of 04 set the min distance |
| | `collisionReleaseTime` / `collisionWhiskerAngle` | 0.4 / **0** | the whisker went to 0 in the field and stayed there |
| vehicle | `vehicleDistanceScale` / `vehicleDistanceGain` | **1 / 5** | round: "too far on entry, let speed earn it back" |
| | `vehicleDistanceSpeed` | 40 | first guess, accepted |
| | `vehicleFovKick` / `FovMinSpeed` / `FovMaxSpeed` | 0.175 / **6 / 28** | round: invisible — the band ran past what cars reach |
| | `vehicleFovLambda` | 2.5 | first guess, accepted |
| | `vehicleYawLagTime` / `vehicleRecenterDelaySec` | 0.35 / 1.5 | accepted (the JERK was a latch, not a number) |
| | `vehicleVerticalLagTime` / `vehicleCollisionReleaseTime` | 0.15 / 0.6 | accepted |
| drift | `driftLookBlend` / `driftSlipDeadZone` / `driftMinSpeed` | 0.5 / **0.05 / 6** | round: gated past what this physics produces |
| motion | `bobAmplitude` / `bobCyclesPerMetre` | **0.025 / 0.25** | round: "shakes so hard you cannot concentrate" — it was 4.9 Hz |
| | `landingDipScale` | **0** | three rounds, never visible at a third-person orbit — ships OFF |
| | `shakeScale` / `shakeImpactForce` | 0.08 / 250 000 | accepted after the burst bug was fixed |
| | `sprintFovKick` | **0.07** | round: invisible at 0.04 with a band that completed at top speed |
| | `reducedMotion` | false | the comfort switch, off by default |

### 2026-07-25 — the exit exam: numbers

**Director cost**: `stepCamera` **0.568 µs mean / 0.620 µs p95** on foot with every layer live (microbench
row 080/06). The plan's budget was **0.1 ms p95** — this is 160× under it.

**Casts per frame: 2**, against a budget of 5. One sphere cast toward the eye (the two flanking whiskers do
NOT fire: the 04 field round set `collisionWhiskerAngle` to 0) plus one `groundBelow` ray for the floor
guard. The plan assumed whiskers would be hot in interiors; the field removed them instead.

**Ritual sweep — the bench-bypass proof.** The full 8-scene `?bench=all` leg, headless, with the whole chain
live: [`2026-07-25-headless-080-closeout-sweep.json`](../../benchmarks/opensa-engine/2026-07-25-headless-080-closeout-sweep.json).

| scene | avg ms | p95 | fps | draws |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ls-noon | 8.333 | 9.3 | 120.0 | 1181 |
| sf-fog-dawn | 8.384 | 9.3 | 119.3 | 985 |
| lv-night | 8.328 | 9.2 | 120.1 | 1647 |
| country-dusk | 8.331 | 9.7 | 120.0 | 861 |
| ocean-horizon | 8.329 | 10.3 | 120.1 | 24 |
| ls-rain-night | 8.329 | 10.2 | 120.1 | 966 |
| ganton-noon | 8.323 | 10.2 | 120.2 | 1397 |
| ganton-night | 8.329 | 10.2 | 120.1 | 1394 |

`ls-noon` is the one scene with a directly comparable headless BEFORE (the 080/01 row): **8.333 vs 8.334 ms
and 1181 vs 1181 draws** — identical, which is exactly the invariant this row exists to prove. Every leg is
vsync-capped at 120 fps, so the sweep CANNOT resolve a small CPU regression; it proves the bench path is
untouched, and the user's in-game sweep remains the pass-comparable series.

**The soak leg was NOT run.** What it looks for is drift and leaks in rig state over a long session, and the
honest answer was to remove the drift structurally rather than watch for it for half an hour: `bobPhase` now
wraps to one turn (it grew ~11 rad/s and would have cost `Math.sin` precision over hours) and the shake's
noise clock only advances while a shake is alive. A test steps the layer through **an hour of sprinting with
a crash every minute** and asserts every accumulator stays bounded. A real `?soak` leg remains owed if the
user wants the memory half of it too.

**2026-07-25 — `?cam=legacy` deleted early (user's call: "the camera is fine now").** Removed: the host's
`params.get('cam')` read, `CameraRigState.legacy`, and its five branches in `stepCamera` (instant zoom,
centering gate, follow-point smoothing gate, `attached`, input smooth time) plus the `steerYawChannel` gate.
The parity gate did NOT retire with it: `camera-director.test.ts` now steps a `RIGID` config
(`inputSmoothTime: 0`, `zoomLambda: Infinity`) and still matches the pre-080 inline host math to 12 digits —
the position channels need no zeroing there because a static focus keeps the look point exactly on target.
Test count 110 → 109 (the "does not compose on the legacy path" case went with the path); the rest of the
suite is untouched. `tsc --noEmit` + eslint clean.
