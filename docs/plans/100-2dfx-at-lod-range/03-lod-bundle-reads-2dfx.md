# 03 — The LOD bundle reads the cell bake's 2dfx

**SHIPPED 2026-08-08** (code + tool-level verification; the FIELD check is owed to the chain's single
rebuild — see below). Part of [100 — 2dfx survives to LOD range](readme.md). Landed in `packages/cell-weld`
and `tools/opensa-pack`. Depended on
[02](../../../tools/opensa-lod-generator/docs/plans/006-cell-bake-carries-effects.md). **This is the step that
makes the whole OpenSA line visible** — without it, 01 and 02 write bytes nobody reads.

Neither package keeps a numbered plan chain, so the record stays here.

## Context

`weld.ts` gathered 2dfx **HD-only**:

```ts
// 2dfx corona anchors (074/06 row 13) — HD level only (LOD duplicates would double every lamp).
if (!lod) {
  collectLights(...);
  collectParticles(...);
}
```

and the roadsign weld sat in the same branch. Every instance of `opensa-lod-generator`'s `lods.ipl` is flagged
`isLod` by `resolveMap`'s `markCellLods`, so the cell bake's section was unreachable. The comment names the
real hazard — **doubling** — and any fix has to answer it.

## Decisions

1. **Lights and emitters come from the LOD MODEL's own 2dfx.** That is what step 02 bakes, it is already
   cell-relative, and it keeps the thinning decisions in the generator rather than re-derived in the welder.
   No second pass over HD models.
2. **Doubling is prevented by the STREAMER — verified, not assumed.** `CellSlot.current` is a single
   `Level | null`, and the HD↔LOD swap in `Streaming.create` calls `cells.unload(previousKey)` in the same
   synchronous call that loaded the replacement ("the replacement is live — drop the old level the same
   frame; no hole, no double-draw"). No frame can render both levels of one slot, so no explicit suppress is
   needed. What a bundle must still guarantee is that it carries each anchor ONCE, and that is what the tests
   pin.
3. **Roadsigns keep coming from the WORLD-KEYED pre-pass, for both levels — a correction to decision 1.**
   This is the one place a LOD's effects do NOT come from the LOD model, and the reason is a measurement the
   step did not have when it was written: **131 of the map's 489 plates sit outside the cell holding the
   instance that carries them** (`opensa-lod-generator/006`). Read off the LOD model, such a plate welds into
   cell A's LOD bundle while `collectRoadsigns` files it under cell B — **two different keys**, so decision
   2's one-level-per-slot rule does not cover them and the plate draws twice whenever A is LOD-resident and B
   is HD-resident, which at a 250 u grid and a 380 u HD ring is an ordinary standing position. Bucketing by
   world position keeps every plate on exactly one key at both levels.
4. **Particle anchors ride as `OscellParticle`, lights as `OscellLight`** — both unchanged in shape, no format
   version bump.
5. **A LOD light is never breakable** (`owner: 0`): breakables are HD-only by design, so a far corona cannot
   be tied to a prop that can be smashed at that range. Passed explicitly rather than relied on via "the
   baked cell model is not in `breakableModels` anyway".

## What shipped

- `weld.ts`: the `!lod` gate is gone from `collectLights` / `collectParticles` and from the roadsign weld;
  `weldCellParts`' `roadsigns` parameter is documented as feeding both levels.
- `opensa-pack/convert.ts`: `weldGridCell` hands the same world-keyed roadsign list to both levels.
- Tests: a LOD bundle carries the anchors its cell model declares, at the same positions the HD bundle puts
  them; each bundle carries every anchor and every plate exactly once; a LOD bundle with no sign list welds no
  text, and with one welds real geometry (bucket rows grow, not just the counter).

## Verification

**Answered before any code was written (the step's own first task):** HD and LOD of one slot can never be
resident together — see decision 2 for the mechanism and the line that guarantees it.

**Tool-level, against real assets** — twelve real cells baked in-process through
`createGtaSaLodAdapter().bakeCell()`, which needs no pmb run:

| Cell | Instances | 2dfx entries | Section | Breakdown |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 9,−7 | 290 | 195 | 19 360 B | 189 lights, 3 emitters, **3 plates** |
| 3,−7 | 288 | 185 | 18 504 B | 185 lights |
| 9,0 | 277 | 64 | 5 996 B | 51 lights, 8 emitters, **5 plates** |
| 5,1 | 250 | 111 | 8 376 B | 60 lights, **49 emitters**, 2 plates |
| 8,9 | 234 | 331 | 32 936 B | 328 lights, 3 emitters |

12 of 12 carry a section; **2066 lights, 103 emitters, 17 plates** between them. Per-entry cost, read off the
run: a light is **100 B**, an emitter **44 B**, a plate **108 B**. Across those twelve cells the new types add
**6368 B of 213 016 B (+3.1 %)**. Map-wide that projects to 878 × 44 + 489 × 108 ≈ **89 KB** added to the cell
LOD DFFs, against the 22 366 lights already there.

**The FIELD check ran 2026-08-08**, on the first pak built after this chain (buildTime `11:42 08-08-2026`,
pmb `--exclude sa --keep-work` + fetch-pack). It needed that build: the pack's LOD input is a pmb intermediate
(`<out>/.work/opensa-lod`) the pipeline deletes as it consumes it, and the built tree's `lods.img` holds
`.osm`, the pack's OUTPUT — so no earlier tree could be asked.

**The chimney half PASSES.** Subject: the Las Venturas plant stacks (`vegasplant09/10`, `smoke30m`), shot from
open desert due west at **300, 400, 440 and 600 u**, camera aimed with the new `?look=x,y,z` knob. Every stack
carries its plume at every distance, **including 600 u** — past the ~440 u point where the LOD bundle is the
only thing left to carry an emitter, and where before this chain there was nothing.

**Nothing doubles.** One plume per stack in all four shots, including 400 and 440 — inside the streaming
hysteresis band, which is where two resident levels would have shown as a pair. That is the field's answer to
the `slot.current` argument this step's code makes; the argument now has a measurement under it.

**The PLATE half was NOT closable by eye, so it got an instrument instead.** A street-name plate is 2.4 m
wide, so at the 440 u where the question lives it subtends ~8 px in a 1440-wide capture — "readable" is not
physically available there, and "present vs blank" is a judgement about a smudge. `.oscell` **minor 8** now
records the roadsign GLYPH-QUAD count per cell and the engine sums it over VISIBLE cells
(`EngineStats.roadsignQuadsRecorded`, HUD `signs N`). Roadsign text welds into an ordinary beam bucket, so
nothing downstream could tell it apart — the count is the only thing that can.

**Read 2026-08-08 and the answer is clean, at both layers:**

- **In the pak**, every cell's LOD level carries EXACTLY its HD level's quads — the cell holding the
  `se_bit_12` board (`1,3`) reads 146 at both, and so does every other cell in the probe. That is the
  world-keyed pre-pass feeding both levels one list: nothing lost, nothing welded twice.
- **In the field**, standing north of that board with the camera aimed at it: **1240 quads at 200 u, 1318 at
  600 u.** Past the HD boundary the number does not fall — it rises, because a further view frames more
  cells, each carrying its own plates.

Measured on a rect-limited probe pak (`--rect -1,1,3,8`, `--no-ao`, so NOT a shipping build) welded from the
kept `.work/opensa-lod`. **The canonical `build/original/opensa` pak predates minor 8 and reads `signs 0` —
which means UNKNOWN, not none, until the next full rebuild.**

## Measurements / notes

- **HD/LOD simultaneous residency: impossible by construction** — one `slot.current`, and the swap unloads the
  old key inside `create()`.
- **Anchors added to the LOD bundles, per type**: every cell LOD's own section — projected map-wide from the
  measured corpus, 22 366 lights / 878 emitters / 489 plates, the last two new in this chain.
- **Pak bytes delta**: not measured directly (no rebuild). The DFF-side projection above is ~89 KB of new 2dfx
  payload; the welded glyph geometry for 489 plates duplicated into LOD bundles is the larger unknown and is
  what the rebuild's report should be read for.
- **Frame cost in the band**: unmeasured, and note that [04](04-authored-cull-distance.md) showed the bench
  cannot see emitter cost at all — the meaningful measurement here is pak size and the visual check, not
  `gpuMs.pass`.
