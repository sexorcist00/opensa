# 074·07 — Baked channels (static shadows, AO/skyVis, emissive mask)

[← chain](readme.md) · prev: [06 effects](06-world-effects-parity.md) · next: [08 dynamics](08-dynamics.md)

The [066/03](../066-pmb-modern-tool/03-baked-sun-occlusion-shadows.md) and
[066/04](../066-pmb-modern-tool/04-ambient-emissive-channels.md) specs executed against the NEW target: the
bakers land in `opensa-pack` (03), the consumers in the world WGSL (06), the storage in the `.oscell` channels
reserved since v0 (02 — no format bump). 066 stays the spec source; this doc only records what changes.

## What transfers, what changes

## Bake mechanics (decisions to make here, measured)

- Occlusion source geometry: the MERGED cell groups themselves (post-weld — the tool already holds
  world-space triangles); raycasts via a BVH built per district at convert time.
- Sun visibility: sample the sun arc at K elevations (066/03's analytic-vs-sampled decision — resolve with a
  quality/size table; start K=4 packed into one unorm8x4 reuse of the reserved space).
- Bake cost is offline and parallel (worker pool per cell); budget = converter wall-time ledger.

## Tasks

- [x] District BVH + raycaster in the tool (`bvh.ts`: median-split over triangle AABBs, iterative any-hit
      Möller–Trumbore; occlusion queries only).
- [x] Sun-vis bake v1 (scalar, 066/03 v1) + channel writer + WGSL consumer in 06·3. No runtime CSM exists in
      this engine to A/B against — the acceptance test becomes "under-bridge/canyon direct sun dies, smooth
      under camera motion". Field ✅.
- [ ] **v2 DIRECTIONAL — BUILT AND FIELD-REVERTED (2026-07-12), DEFERRED → [ideas/0.6.0/04-graphic-improvements/01](../../ideas/0.6.0/plans/04-graphic-improvements/01-baked-directional-shadows.md)** (user decision; the ideas doc carries the full attempt/problem/solution record and the receiver-densification prerequisite): with the fixed-azimuth arc, per-vertex visibility is a THRESHOLD
      function of elevation — the bake scans 8 ascending elevations (×2 disc jitter) for the first-lit
      crossing and a penumbra spread. Storage (no bump): threshold → `normal.w` (/1.1; 1.1 = never lit),
      softness → layer-u16 bits 8–14 (bit 15 = stochastic); current arc elevation rides the spare
      `sunDir.w`. Runtime = `smoothstep(threshold ± softness, elevation)` — the static shadow TRACKS the
      moving sun (morning shade recedes as it climbs), still no map, no jitter. The moon gates on the
      NOON visibility (open-sky proxy) — the sun threshold at night elevation would kill moonlight globally.
      LS cell 9,-7: 174 k always-lit / 60.8 k never / roofline-threshold tail between, avg softness 0.084;
      bake 38.3 s LS (27.5 M rays). Non-monotonic visibility collapses to first-on (documented).
      **REVERT verdict (noon field screens)**: per-vertex receivers on SA's metre-sparse meshes make
      directional thresholds unusable — narrow occluders (bridges!) FALL BETWEEN road verts (no shadow at
      all), interpolation punches hole-shaped artifacts and diagonal smears on giant polys, and LOD verts
      self-darken. The SCALAR v1 look (accepted in the field) is restored as the shipping consumer; kept
      from the v2 round: the sliver filter, LOD baking (0.6 push-off), the zenith-converging arc, and the
      softness bit-packing (written but unused). **Prerequisite to un-park: converter-side subdivision of
      large receiver polys (~4 m grid on ground planes) — a pmb-grade task; the 066/03 spec itself assumed
      welded/optimizer meshes.** The v2 design + storage encoding stay in this doc; the code path is in git
      history of this session.
- [x] skyVis/AO bake + consumer (v1 — see decisions below). SSAO never existed in this engine, so the
      "SSAO dies" comparison is against the WebGL prod pass when plan 10's A/B lands.
- [x] Emissive mask bake (night-window detection from the existing night-prelit data) + 06·8 swap.
      2026-07-12: the luma-delta detection moved OFFLINE into the welder (high byte of `layerChannels` +
      `EMISSIVE` channel bit; refinable later without engine changes); the WGSL glow uses the baked mask
      when the cell carries it (per-cell flag bits in `cell.origin.w`: bit 0 sunVis, bit 1 emissive) and
      falls back to the runtime heuristic for old paks. LS rect: 77,601 masked verts across 20/20 HD cells.
- [x] Ledger: bake wall-time + ray counts recorded below (GPU Δ = per-vertex attribute, expected ≈ free;
      confirmed by the ritual bench after reconvert).

## v1 decisions (AO/skyVis, 2026-07-12)

- Two-phase convert: `weldCellParts` (scratch rows, `WELD_ROW` grew 17→18 with an `ao` slot defaulting open)
  → `bakeAo` mutates rows in place → `assembleCell` encodes. `weldCell` keeps the one-shot no-bake path.
- Occluders = HD opaque+cutout groups only; blend glass and beam cones never darken the sky.
- Only HD vertices are baked. LOD keeps the fully-open default: LOD verts sit NEAR but not ON the HD surfaces
  (self-occlusion noise), and LOD is viewed from ≥380 units — revisit only if the HD↔LOD swap pops visibly.
- 12 cosine-weighted rays (fixed golden-ratio fan — deterministic, no RNG), 60-unit reach, origins pushed
  0.08 off the surface. Unique-(pos,normal) dedup cache cuts repeat rays (~10 % on LS — GTA verts are
  already heavily split).
- Storage: low byte of the `layerChannels` u16 (074/02, no format bump) + `AO_SKY_VIS` channel bit.
  WGSL treats byte 0 as UNBAKED → fully open, so pre-bake paks render unchanged.
- Consumer: modulates ONLY the indirect (prelit) term — `env.aoStrength` (default 0.6; SA prelit already
  carries baked darkening, full strength double-darkens). Lab A/B: `?ao=<float>`, `?ao=0` disables.
- `--no-ao` CLI flag skips the bake; `report.json` gains the `ao` block (ms, rays, verts, tris).

## v1 decisions (sun-vis, 2026-07-12)

- Scalar sunVis (066/03 v1): elevation-weighted average visibility over the day arc — kills the direct term
  where the sun NEVER reaches (bridges, canyons); does not track the moving sun (v2 = directional).
- The arc mirrors the lab drivers — **the standing rule: change one, change both** (exercised twice already:
  the zenith-convergence fix, then the TRUE east→west arc). Current form (2026-07-12 evening): runtime
  `azX = −cos(π(h−6)/12)` (sunrise −x → noon near-zenith → sunset +x, z tilt × `azimuthScale = 1−0.75e`);
  the bake samples each elevation TWICE at `x = ∓√(1−e²)` (morning + evening — this pair replaced the disc
  jitter at the same ray cost), with a PER-RAY facing test (an east wall keeps its morning sun).
- 2 disc-jittered rays per elevation (±0.03 elevation → baked penumbra), 400-unit reach. Arc samples behind
  the face are SKIPPED (N·L zeroes them at runtime) — halves the rays; a never-lit vertex costs none.
- Storage: `normal.w` (snorm8, 0..127 used) + `SUN_VIS` channel bit; the ENGINE gates per cell via
  `cell.origin.w` (set from channelMask at load) — **no in-data sentinel**, the AO byte-0 lesson applied.
- Consumer: `sunNdl ×= mix(1, sunVis, cell.origin.w × sunVisStrength)` — direct term only. Default strength
  1 (a shadow is a shadow); lab A/B `?sunvis=N`. One district BVH shared by both bakes.

| 2026-07-12 | **GOTCHA: sentinel collision**      | field report "no darkening under bridges" — fully-occluded verts encode byte 0 = the WGSL "unbaked" sentinel → the DARKEST verts rendered fully OPEN. District-wide: 262 k verts (23 %!) were byte-0. Fix: bake floors visibility at 1/255. Second cause is expected v1 behaviour: at noon the DIRECT sun term dominates an up-facing road — AO modulates indirect only; under-bridge sun darkness arrives with the sun-vis bake                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

Fix: SLIVER filter in `collectOccluders` — triangles with area < 1 % of longestEdge² (wires/cables/railing bars) never occlude EITHER bake; LS dropped 71.9 k sliver tris. Softness floor also raised 0.03 → 0.06 to calm dawn transitions on huge polys                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 2026-07-12 | **v2 field round 2 fixes**          | (a) noon shadows landed BESIDE bridges / collapsed to blobs — the FIXED azimuth keeps the noon sun ~19° off vertical; fix = azimuth CONVERGES to zenith as the sun climbs (`azimuthScale = 1 − 0.75e`, mirrored bake + drivers). (b) "LODs don't shadow" — visible HD/LOD seams (sidewalk shadowed, road not); fix = LOD cells bake BOTH channels against the HD BVH with a 0.6-unit ray push-off (LOD verts sit near-but-not-on HD surfaces). (c) KNOWN LIMIT recorded: small-object shadows (lamp posts, sign gantries) are beyond per-vertex baking — receiver verts are metres apart; vanilla SA statics don't cast them either; crisp near-field shadows would need texel-space baking or the dynamic near cascade (08) |
| 2026-07-12 | **arc round 3: east→west**          | field: the sun rose and set at the same azimuth → true east→west arc landed in drivers + standalone + BAKE (morning/evening ray pairs, per-ray facing test); all paks rebaked.
