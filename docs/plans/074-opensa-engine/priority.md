# 074 — Priority order: from here to "real OpenSA drives on the new engine"

The single ordered list of what remains, in the order I would execute it (2026-07-12, end of the Fable
session). Each step names its plan doc, why it sits where it sits, and what "done" looks like. Three
milestones structure it: **A — the whole map is deliverable · B — the player lives in the world ·
C — the flip and the endgame.**

Current state (end of 2026-07-13): milestones A and B1–B4 are DONE/PARKED — the FULL map converts in one
command (~30 s bakeless incl. clouds+water; 202.6 s with shadow bakes) and streams everywhere; the PLAYER
walks/runs/jumps in the real app with prod HUD/zones/pointer-lock and in-game benches (all 6 scenes
vsync-120); Safari smoke ✅; the config-API parity module ships prod tunables to the engine; water v3
PARKED as leftover (0.6.0 plan).

**NEXT — the ladder (user, 2026-07-14; B5 + B6 done, reflections inserted the same day):**
**HERE → B6.5 map-lighting bugs.**
B5 vehicles ✅ → **B5r VEHICLE REFLECTIONS — v1 SHIPPED but REJECTED in the field; the deep rework is now
its own plan, [16](16-vehicle-paint.md)** (the gap is structural: no tonemapper, no environment probe — both
of which the three path HAS, which is why prod looked better. Not a tuning problem) → B6 2dfx particles +
textured coronas →
**B6.5 MAP-LIGHTING BUGS — see [17](17-map-lighting.md). Round 1 attempted 2026-07-14 and FULLY REVERTED**
(per-pixel 2dfx lamps fixed the polygon-shaped light patches but cost 120 fps → 25; prod affords per-pixel
only because its pool is 12 and ours is 64). The plan carries the measurements (12 004 of 12 964 map models
ship NO normals; SA's authored light ranges; the 14 % of lights that illuminate nothing) and the two open
blocker: **why prod renders the same map clean on identical data**. (The feared 120 → 90 fps regression was
CLOSED — it was the experiment's PAK left on disk, not any commit; B5/B6 cost nothing.) Original scope: (user, 2026-07-14: the world-lighting oddities that surfaced while field-testing
the headlights — the per-vertex pool artefacts were only the first; collect and fix the rest) → B7
destruction objects → B7 animation objects → then the WebGL-prod `?bench=all` baseline and the C1 criteria
run → flip. C2 cleanup stays GATED on an explicit command. B6/B7 are prod-PARITY gaps (prod renders all
three classes), so they land BEFORE the C1 parity sign-off, not after it.

## Milestone A — the whole map is deliverable

**A1. meshopt + brotli wire compression** — ✅ DONE 2026-07-13 (14 ledger: geometry 4.23×, full-LS
497.5 → 311.2 MB ≤ the 400 MB gate; worker-side decode NET faster than deflate-only; brotli deliberately
skipped — serve-time `Content-Encoding: br` remains) · size M
Geometry is the measured 82 % of the 1.15 GB full-LS pak; this is the top lever and it touches the format
boundary (encode in `opensa-pack`, decode in the pak worker), so it lands BEFORE more paks get produced.
**Done:** full-LS pak ≤ ~400 MB on the wire; decode adds < 1 ms to worst cell create; bench unchanged.

**A2. Bake worker pool + chunked welding** — ✅ DONE 2026-07-13 (14 ledger: full-LS --bakes 939 → 532 s,
peak RSS 16 → 5.2 GB; serial ≡ pooled SHA-identical; chunk ring = 2 cells ≥ the 400 u sun ray; bakes are
OPT-IN since the same day — `--bakes`, quarter-of-cores default) · size M
Bakes are 91 % of convert time (parallel per cell); welding the whole map cannot hold in one 16 GB heap
(one city already held it). Chunk = region-sized weld scratch with an overlap margin for the bake BVH.
**Done:** the FULL non-modified map converts on the M3 in one command, wall-time recorded (~target ≤ 15 min).

**A3. Full-map pak in the standalone page** — ✅ CORE DONE 2026-07-13 (first FULL-MAP pak: 71.4 s
bakeless, 1121 entries, 769.7 MB wire, `?src=pak-map` in the lab/standalone/game; whole-map `?bench=map`
tour committed to the series — max 14 ms. REMAINING here: the `--bakes` full-map convert and the 30-min
soak) · size S
Convert the full map (A2), serve via range-reads (already landed), fly SF→LV→LS in `opensa-engine.html`.
This is the "whole world on the new engine" demo and the long-haul streaming soak in one.
**Done:** cross-map flight, no leaks (ledger returns to baseline after unload-all), `city`-style bench rows
recorded per region; the M1 stress tails (whip/teleport/30-min soak) close here too.

## Milestone B — the player lives in the world

**B1. Skinning probe — own IFP sampler** — ✅ DONE 2026-07-13 (08 probe note: own sampler + storage
palettes + dynamics vertex-layout family; FIELD ✅ animated ped; the riskiest unknown of the chain is
retired) · size L
Own skinned-mesh path: DFF skin data → engine skinned pipeline (bone matrices in a storage buffer), own IFP
keyframe sampler (three's AnimationMixer is not portable). Probe = CJ idle/walk cycle rendering in the LAB.
**Done:** one animated ped at 120 Hz; the pipeline count stays enumerated; sampler unit-tested against
known IFP curves.

**B2. Dynamic entity API + vehicles** — ✅ v1 DONE 2026-07-13 (rigid-entity layer + vehicle fixture:
parts/wheels/4-colour carcols/lamp day-night texture twins/26 verbatim dummies; light pool 06 row 7 with
headlight producers, bench row accepted. REMAINING in 08: lamp state on braking, headlight cones v2,
chassis_vlo LOD, ok/dam) · size L
The engine grows a small dynamic-object layer next to the static cells: per-frame transforms (storage
buffer), rigid part hierarchies for vehicles (doors/wheels), the entity HANDLES that plan 10's audit said
will replace three mesh refs in gameplay code. Local light pool (06 row 7) lands here — its producers
(headlights/brake lights) finally exist.
**Done:** a drivable-looking vehicle + walking ped rendered by the engine in the lab, moved by game-style
transform updates; light pool lit at night.

**B3. Game boots on the engine (integration phase 2)** — ✅ v1 DONE 2026-07-13 (FIELD ✅: walk/run/jump
around Grove Street with `?engine=opensa`; physics/collision/input REUSED, shared runtime Config, ped-probe
player, data-driven feet. Timecyc driver ✅ 2026-07-13 — the SHARED config→Environment driver
(engine-environment-driver adapter, litFade-dynamic arcs, prod tunables preserved; plan 10 config-API task
closed same day). Zones/HUD + pointer lock ✅ 2026-07-13 (reuse-not-duplicate: prod's DOM <Hud> narrowed to
a HudGame surface — the three Game satisfies it structurally; ZoneNameSystem + info.zon/gxt loaders shared
via ui/zone-data.ts; click = mouse capture, Esc frees, pause exits the lock). In-game benches ✅ 2026-07-13
(`?engine=opensa&bench=<key|all>`: prod's BENCH_SCENES + samplePath reused, host-specific harness —
physics.teleport anchor, per-scene weather via the shared driver + dome crossfade, settle→warmup→timed
capture of engine stats, SAME `[bench] {json}` console protocol → C1 compares own-engine vs WebGL rows
directly). **B3 is now FULLY closed** — next: vehicles-in-game (entity handles), water v1, C1 criteria run) ·
size L
`Game.create` grows the capability branch: own engine renderer behind a flag, three-WebGL still default.
Physics/zones/time/logic reuse as-is (audited renderer-agnostic); streaming follows the PLAYER; picking
goes through an engine-side ray query against the 07 cell BVHs; HUD/UI unchanged (DOM).
**Done:** walk and drive around Los Santos in the real app with `?engine=opensa` — gameplay parity with
the WebGL path for movement/camera/streaming; benches from inside the GAME, not the lab.

**B4. Water v1 + remaining world effects** — [06](06-world-effects-parity.md) rows 12/13 tails · size M
✅/PARKED 2026-07-13: water went v1→v2→v3 in one day (runtime flat → shore-field bake → TRUE-depth bake
with surf/foam/swash; 12 field rounds logged in plan 06) and is PARKED as a leftover at v3 — the look
ceiling is the 2005 sprite textures; resume = docs/ideas/0.6.0/plans/02-water-realism (authored textures
first). Coronas textured + 2dfx particles (row 13 tails) LEFT B4 UNFINISHED — they are now **B6** below
(the tails were nearly lost when B4 closed; that is why they get their own step).
The game needs a sea surface; v1 = flat animated surface with the sky-shared fog (the "real waves" rework
stays the 0.5.0 idea).
**Done:** coastline looks intentional (water v3 accepted as a leftover).

**B5. Vehicles in the game** — ✅ DONE 2026-07-14, FIELD ✅ (5 steps, all in the 08 ledger) · size M
1 engine capability (model↔instance split — ONE upload per car TYPE, instances share it; per-submesh
visibility; pivot/scale/world-override on the rigid entity) · 2 shared browser BUILDER in renderware (all
four wheel conventions, `_ok`/`_dam`, `_vlo`, `extraN`, door hinges, lamp tags; **paint is a per-vertex SLOT,
not a bake** — one model, many colours) · 3 `VehicleHandle`: three is OUT of vehicle gameplay (a grep for
`from 'three'` in `game/src/vehicle/` returns only Vector3/Quaternion MATH) · 4 cars drive in
`?engine=opensa` (systems REUSED verbatim; new seam found and narrowed: `VehicleAnimator`) · 5 lamps
(per-vehicle state, cones, coronas on the EXISTING corona pass).
**Done:** drive around Los Santos with `?engine=opensa`; no three types left in the vehicle logic path.

**B6. 2dfx particles + textured coronas** — ✅ DONE 2026-07-14, FIELD ✅ (ledger: 06 row 13) · size M
Shipped: `.oscell` minor 2 carries a particle table (converter `weld.ts#collectParticles`, HD cells only);
the FX baking is shared at `renderware/src/fx/bake-fx.ts` (the three path still keeps its own copy — that
collapse is C2 work); the engine loops the particle lifecycle entirely in the vertex shader; coronas and the
MOON are textured from `particle.txd` (sprite sizes read from the DATA — swapping in a higher-res moon just
works) with a real terminator for the phase. FIVE field rounds, every one a convention I assumed instead of
checked (GTA Z-up force/direction, SA sprites with no alpha channel, heat-haze prims, the UV range on a ±1
quad, size-is-a-diameter) — all five are written up in the 06 row 13 ledger.
Tests: `renderware/fx/{bake-fx,sprites}.test.ts`, `apps/web/.../engine-particles.test.ts` (the axis swap),
and the converter on the real SF fountain (`weld.test.ts`, new `dff/particles/fountain_sfw.*` fixture).
OLD SCOPE (kept for the record):
A REAL flip-parity gap, not a nice-to-have: prod renders these (plan [044](../044-world-effects.md),
`renderware/src/three/build-particles.ts`, `graphics.effects` config with a master toggle) and the map
carries **113 type-1 entries** — 20 `WS_factorysmoke` columns, 8 fires, 6 fountains, vents, insects,
waterfall mist. Our side is empty from the CONVERTER up: `weld.ts#collectLights` extracts type-0 (corona)
anchors ONLY, so the pak holds no particle data at all. Work = converter (type-1 anchors + `effects.fxp`
params — the text parser exists at `renderware/src/parsers/text/fxp.parser.ts` — into the `.oscell` light
table) + engine (instanced billboard pass, shares the corona pass; emitter simulation). Textured corona
sprites (`particle.txd` coronastar/coronamoon — the moon disc is still procedural) ride the same path.
NOT to be confused with `docs/ideas/0.4.0/.../a3-2dfx-particle-emitters-lods.md` (emitters on LODs for the
REAL SA game via the ASI — a different target).
**Done:** ✅ chimneys smoke and fountains run in `?engine=opensa`; ledger 06 row 13 closed → 14/14.

**B7. Destruction objects, then animation objects** — [08](08-dynamics.md) · size M each

- **B7·a Destruction (breakable) objects — ✅ DONE 2026-07-14, FIELD ✅.** Props shatter into analytic shards
  (shared baker with the three path; the ground probe FIXES prod's sinking-shards defect), uproot props
  (lampposts, meters — object.dat column G, which our parser had been discarding) fall over as real dynamic
  bodies with a convex-hull collider, and a smashed prop takes its 2dfx coronas with it (`.oscell` minor 4).
  Breakables stay INSIDE the merged bundle — the engine degenerates their index ranges in place, so the break
  costs no draw call (splitting them out per placement measured 4.5× the draws). Five field rounds and every
  lesson is in the 08 ledger — read it before touching this.
- **B7·b Animation objects — ✅ DONE 2026-07-14, FIELD ✅.** Garage doors, windmills and the spinning signs
  move (64 placements). No new engine machinery was needed: an IFP's "bones" ARE the clump's frames, so the
  B1 `IfpSampler` composes the chain and `setPartWorldMatrix` (written for damage debris) drives each atomic.
  The converter leaves ONLY the frames the clip moves out of the bundle — `burger01_LAw` is a 22×35 m diner
  that lives in the anim section purely because its sign spins, and both dropping it (the plan-041 "blue
  hole") and promoting it whole are bad trades. Ledger + lessons: [08](08-dynamics.md).

- **B7·d PROCEDURAL CLUTTER — OPEN, see [19](19-procobj.md).** The countryside is bald: prod scatters and
  renders grass/rocks/cacti (a per-category density lottery, 150/cell), the engine draws none of it. Found in
  the field because the engine host was passing NONE of prod's clutter knobs, so the adapter collided every
  blade of grass it never drew: **9 803 static bodies → 17 ms per Rapier step → 12 fps standing still**, with
  the fixed-step spiral hiding the cause. Colliders are off on the engine host until the rendering lands (the
  adapter's own rule: no invisible obstacles) — turn them back on TOGETHER, with prod's budget.

- **B7·c UV-SCROLL animation — OPEN, see [18](18-uv-anim.md).** A prod-parity gap the own engine has never
  had: the crawling neon (LV skull sign), conveyor belts. A DIFFERENT mechanism from B7·b — marked in the
  DFF (UVAnimDict + the material's UV Anim PLG), plays globally in sync, and is already fully PARSED; the
  converter and the engine simply ignore it. The design decision is where a scrolling material's two floats
  live when the world samples a baked texture array (a per-vertex anim slot + a global table is the likely
  answer, and it costs a `.oscell` minor bump).

## Milestone C — the flip and the endgame

**C1. Flip criteria run** — [10](10-integration-flip.md) · size M
The pre-agreed gates: 60 fps ls-noon @2× retina; ≥ WebGL fps on EVERY bench scene; parity screenshot
sign-off; stress matrix + 30-min soak green in Chrome and Safari (the Safari row is still unvisited!).
**Done:** the flip decision doc with every ledger linked; own engine becomes the default renderer.

**C2. Cleanup** — [13](13-cleanup.md) · size M
Drop the three-WebGL path, the 073 flag zoo, three/babylon/postprocessing (user decision: no WebGL
fallback). Every deletion PR bench-gated. **GATED on a separate explicit user command (2026-07-13
directive): after the flip the old path STAYS for a side-by-side comparison period (settings/picture/
anything forgotten) — C2 never auto-starts from C1 passing.**
**Done:** dependency/bundle ledger recorded; one renderer in the tree.

**C3. pmb integration + the exit exam** — [14](14-pmb-integration.md) · size L
`opensa-pack` becomes a perfect-map-builder stage (wind/stochastic/subdivision data move into pmb config);
full modded profiles (anderius/carcer/gostown) convert and run the final bench matrix.
**Done:** the headline the chain exists for — **the user's full modded SA at 60 fps on the own engine**.

## Standing rules while executing (do not relearn these)

- Bench ritual after every perf-relevant change; series.md is append-only; >10 % GPU/frame p95 regression
  blocks until explained (Metal timestamp quantization: trust avg when max is bit-identical).
- Reconvert BOTH paks (`pak`, `pak-sf`, later full-map) whenever the converter or manifest changes.
- Golden WGSL snapshots: change → review the diff → `vitest -u`; naga guardrails stay (no uniform-space
  arrays, no unbounded loops).
- ALL project docs and code stay English-only — repo-wide, not just plans (user rule, broadened
  2026-07-13); field verdicts get paraphrased in English; every verdict and measurement goes into the
  owning plan's ledger.
- Parked items have written prerequisites — check ideas/0.5.0 before re-attempting directional shadows,
  weather wind, or stochastic default-on.
