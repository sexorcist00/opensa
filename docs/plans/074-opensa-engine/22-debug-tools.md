# 074·22 — Debug tools port: F2 debugger + photo mode + pointer capture

[← chain](readme.md) · the LAST pre-flip blocker ([10](10-integration-flip.md))

**Status: BLOCKER (user, 2026-07-17) — "the debugger is core workflow; its point is live config
mutation." Scope raised from an audit to the full port. THE FLIP SEQUENCE: this plan ships →
remind the user to run `?bench=all` on the display AND the parity screenshots → flip.**

## The headline finding (audit, 2026-07-17)

**The engine host mounts NONE of the three debug tools today:**

1. **F2 debugger** — `DebugOverlay` + `DebugActions` live only in `canvas-host.tsx` (three);
   `engine-canvas-host.tsx` has a read-only `<pre>` HUD and URL params.
2. **Photo mode** — prod's **K+M chord** toggles a detached free-fly camera
   (`game.setFlyCamera` → camera mode `'fly'`: ARROWS move, mouse looks, gameplay untouched;
   F2 drops fly mode; `fly-camera` event). Nothing similar on the engine host.
3. **Pointer capture button** — prod shows the `sa-capture` **"Click to play"** button whenever the
   pointer is not locked (lock via `canvas.requestPointerLock()`, look = movementX/Y while locked,
   pause/F2 exit the lock, `pointerlockchange` drives the button visibility). The engine host locks on
   canvas click but has NO button — no affordance telling the player to click.

Mechanics that make the port cheap: every debugger control mutates the shared runtime `Config` in
place (`game-runtime-config.ts` — ONE source of truth, both hosts already consume it), and the engine
host re-reads config every frame through the environment driver. Bucket-B controls work the moment the
overlay mounts; bucket A needs `DebugActions` implementations; bucket C needs per-host gating.

## Task breakdown (detailed — nothing gets lost)

### Phase 1 — decouple the overlay from the three `Game` object

- [x] 1.1 Inventory every `game.*` touch inside `debug-overlay.tsx` / `perf-panel.tsx` /
      `map-inspector.tsx`. **RESULT — the surface is far narrower than feared:** `debug-overlay.tsx`
      touches the game object exactly ONCE (`game.events.on('city')`); `perf-panel.tsx` touches it
      NEVER (it already goes through `DebugActions.setPerfEnabled/perfStats/gpuTimings`); the whole
      rest — `getConfig`, `getViewCell`, `listCells`, `setMapViewer`, `setManualCells`,
      `setShowCollision`, `hideSelectedObject`, `restoreHiddenObjects`, `events.on('select')` — is
      confined to `map-inspector.tsx`, i.e. to the PARKED Map screen.
- [x] 1.2 `DebugGame` = `{ events: Pick<EventBus<GameEvents>, 'on'> }` (the whole overlay view of
      the game). The inspector's `Game`-shaped surface moved to a separate OPTIONAL `mapGame` prop
      instead of widening `DebugGame` — the engine host simply omits it. Prod passes
      `game={game} mapGame={game}`: zero behaviour change.
- [x] 1.3 `debug-capabilities.ts`: `DebugCapabilities` (per-control/per-screen flags; 20 after phase 2 added `cameraRig`) +
      `ALL_DEBUG_CAPABILITIES` (three host, the default when the prop is omitted) +
      `ENGINE_DEBUG_CAPABILITIES` (bucket-C rows off). Screen filtering (`menuFor`) and the split sky
      slider list (`skyControlsFor`) moved OUT of the .tsx into this pure module so they are unit
      testable (the vitest lane is node-only, `.tsx` is e2e territory); `__DEBUGGER_HIDE__` became a
      `menuFor` parameter instead of a global read.
- [x] 1.4 Unit tests — `debug-capabilities.test.ts`, 7 cases (map screen drops for the engine, dev-only
      screens drop in the deploy build, both full menus, god-ray sliders drop / shared sky keys stay).

### Phase 2 — engine-host `DebugActions` (bucket A: gameplay actions) — SHIPPED 2026-07-18

Landed as `apps/web/src/ui/engine-debug-actions.ts` (`createEngineDebugActions(deps)`, thin host accessors
like `setupPerfRuns`) + the wiring in `engine-canvas-host.tsx`; the overlay mounts with
`ENGINE_DEBUG_CAPABILITIES`. Every graphics row is a plain mutation of the shared `Config` — no per-host copy.

- [x] 2.1 `teleport` / `teleportToGanton` / `respawnPlayer` — over the host's `placePlayer` (physics.teleport +
      Transform writes), the same path the bench teleport uses.
- [x] 2.2 `playerCoords()` — the host `viewOf()` (native Z-up).
- [x] 2.3 `setGameTime(minutes)` — host `hour` (the env driver applies it the next frame).
- [x] 2.4 `setWeather` + `weatherList()` — `WeatherTransition.begin` at `config.weatherTransitionSeconds`,
      sharing the live `[`/`]` weather id; list = the renderware `WEATHER_NAMES` (26 entries).
- [x] 2.5 `vehicleModels()` / `spawnVehicle()` / `flipVehicle()` — `vehicleModelsFromIde` + `vehicles.spawn`
      (awaits the worker model build, carcols colour cycle, `groundSnap`). **Direction gotcha found in the
      field:** the first spawn landed BEHIND the camera — the host's `yaw` is a camera azimuth whose native
      forward is `(sin yaw, −cos yaw)`, while a heading `h` points along `(−sin h, cos h)`, so the car spawns
      at `+forward × 5` with heading `yaw + π`. Flip = prod's algorithm with the quaternion written out
      (the host stays three-free).
- [x] 2.6 `breakNearest()` — new `CollisionStreamingSystem.nearestBreakable(position, radius)` (shared, unit
      tested) + `EngineBreakables.breakNearest`; `smash(impact)` was refactored to `smashKey(key, force, …)`
      so the debugger's forced smash (`force = Infinity`) and a real contact share one path. Tuned-
      indestructible props still survive, as in prod.
- [x] 2.7 `setFlyMode(on)` — the PHOTO CAMERA (one implementation, phase 5 adds the chord): a detached eye
      seeded from the live camera, ARROWS move / PageUp-Down lift, the player entity is untouched. The pure
      halves live in `engine-camera.ts` (`flyStep`, `resolveCamera` — bench > photo > follow rig), unit tested.
- [x] 2.8 Camera screen — **split by counterpart**: distance + zoom bounds now re-read live (a debugger change
      re-seeds the wheel zoom; `followZoom` gates the wheel, as in prod). The five follow-RIG sliders
      (height/angle/response/angle limits) have NO engine counterpart — its orbit is mouse yaw+pitch with a
      fixed eye height — so they are gated off by the new `cameraRig` capability (`cameraControlsFor`).
- [x] 2.9 ProcObj screen — the adapter now gets `procObjDensityOf` (0 when a category is disabled, prod's
      wiring) and `setProcObj` re-scatters: `invalidateColliderCache` + `collision.reload()` + clutter cells
      dropped, so render and colliders re-run from ONE scatter. Field: all 7 categories off →
      draws 206 → 186 (repeatably ~10 %), no errors. Owed: a pixel A/B at a clutter-only spot (Truth's Farm
      keeps its AUTHORED bushes, which reads as "nothing happened" on a screenshot).
- [x] 2.10 Browser click-through with the headless harness (fake picker, real LS install), all clean:
      panel opens on F2 · **Map screen absent from the menu** (capability gating) · Position shows
      `CITY: Los Santos` (the shared `CityZoneSystem` is now wired on this host, emitting `'city'` on the
      shared bus) + live coords + the teleport list · Time 12:00 preset → HUD clock 12:01 · Graphics shows
      god-rays/mood/pbrExposure/bloom/tonemap/reflect-intensity and HIDES SSAO, CSM, water, rays-size,
      density/exposure/weight · Vehicles filter + spawn (draws 567 → 618) · fly mode detaches the camera
      while the player coords stay at `2495.0, −1675.0, 13.3` (that is phase 5.5's criterion, met early) ·
      Weather list 26 · 120 fps throughout, no page errors.

### Phase 3 — engine-host graphics wiring + the Perf screen — SHIPPED 2026-07-18

- [x] 3.1 Per-control smoke, metered headless (screenshot → ImageMagick crop means, so "it changed" is a
      NUMBER). Noon, right-third crop vs base `134.9/132.4/128.5`: bloom intensity+threshold → `189.6`
      (huge) · `sky.pbrExposure` 0.05 → `132.2/127.6/118.0` · `sky.mood` 1.0 → `132.9/130.6/128.4` ·
      tone map off → `128.8/125.4/121.4` · `worldLight.dayBrightness` 0.3 → `117.6`. Sky-band crop:
      `sun.godrays` off → blue −3.7 · cloud cover/opacity max → blue −3.2. Night (22:00), same crop vs
      `40.1/31.1/22.6`: `night.emissiveBoost` 4 → `41.6` · `night.skylight` 2 → `54.4` ·
      `moon.brightness` 3 → `52.5` · `worldLight.nightPrelitBrightness` 1.5 → `63.8` ·
      `vehicleReflection.intensity` 3 → the car crop moves `71.9/34.4/33.6` → `28.7/27.0/29.3`.
      **BUG FOUND AND FIXED — the whole point of the pass:** `night.litFade` did nothing (`40.0` before and
      after). `createEngineEnvironmentDriver` destructured `litFade` (and computed `fogScale`) ONCE at build
      time, while the debugger REPLACES nested config objects (`setNight({ litFade: {...} })`) — so both
      froze at their boot values. Both now read inside `apply()`; regression test added
      (`engine-environment-driver.test.ts`). Re-metered: dusk window → 23:00 at hour 22 now flips the world
      to day lighting, `40.1` → `91.8`.
- [x] 3.2 Streaming screen — **user decision (2026-07-18): no slider, a line of text.** The Draw Distance /
      HD / Fog sliders live on the Map screen, which is capability-gated off here anyway; the engine Perf
      screen instead states `draw distance <N> m — boot-only, set with ?draw=N`. No live ring setter is
      built (plan 21 showed re-ringing is its own project); it stays a post-flip option.
- [x] 3.3 Perf screen — REPLACED with the engine ledger (`EnginePerfPanel`, chosen by the presence of
      `engineStats`): FPS · frame avg/p95 · draws · gpu world/post/probe · submit · cells loaded/pending ·
      late creates · residency MB + the by-category breakdown · the draw-distance note. Rows are built by
      the pure `engineStatRows(snapshot)` (unit tested); three's `renderer.info` counters (triangles,
      programs, geometries, textures) have no engine twin and are gone.
- [x] 3.4 **The Perf screen now OWNS the two developer readouts** (user request, 2026-07-18): the
      on-screen HUD and the `[slow]` console breakdown are toggles there, defaulting to
      `process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production'` (`apps/web/src/dev-mode.ts`) — ON while developing, OFF in a
      deploy build. The hidden HUD also stops being composed (the string build is the frame's last work);
      a running soak forces it back on, since its verdict is read OFF the HUD. Field: toggling flips
      `#engine-hud` to `display: none`, and a cross-city teleport after switching logs off produced no new
      `[slow]` lines.
- [x] 3.5 **The F2 tip does not show in development** (user request, same round): `GameHint` returns null
      under `IS_DEV` — it is a notification aimed at players, and it covered the corner of the screen for
      the person who wrote the debugger.

### Phase 4 — bucket C gating on the engine host — SHIPPED 2026-07-18 (NOTHING deleted from prod)

- [x] 4.1 Hidden by capability. **The pass found MORE dead rows than the audit listed** — the phase-3 metering
      had proved a knob "works" while its neighbour in the same block did nothing, so every remaining row was
      traced to a consumer in `engine-environment-driver` / the host. Three additions to the gate:
      **CLOUD COVER** (`cloudCover` — the engine takes cover/scale/tint from the per-weather cloud profile
      since sky v2; only `clouds.opacity` reaches the frame), **MOON SIZE + ELEVATION** (`moonRig` — the
      engine builds its own moon arc and draws the disc in the sky model; `moon.brightness` is the one live
      knob) and **five of the seven WORLD LIGHT scalars** (`worldLightExtras` — the driver applies
      `dayBrightness` and `nightPrelitBrightness` only). Row lists follow the phase-2 pattern
      (`worldLightControlsFor`, unit tested), so the split is data, not JSX conditionals.
- [x] 4.2 Per-row disposition — the table below. Nothing is deleted: C2 (plan 13) removes the three path and
      with it the rows marked _retire_; the rest name the plan that would bring them back.
- [x] 4.3 Verified in the browser — the full engine-host row dump, screen by screen:
      **Atmosphere** = dusk/dawn ×4 · cloud opacity · moon brightness · night emissive · night skylight ·
      world day · world night prelit. **Camera** = distance · min/max zoom · wheel zoom.
      **Graphics** = god rays · mood · pbrExposure · bloom + intensity + threshold · tone map ·
      reflect intensity. **ProcObj / Player / Time / Weather / Position / Perf** unchanged.
      Every surviving row was measured moving the frame in phase 3.1 — the engine debugger now has NO row
      that does nothing.

### Phase 5 — photo mode (prod parity: K+M) — SHIPPED 2026-07-18

- [x] 5.1 Free-fly camera state — landed with phase 2.7 (`flyEye`, seeded from the live camera on entry,
      follow rig resumed on exit; the player entity is never touched).
- [x] 5.2 Prod semantics and prod CONSTANTS: `FLY_SPEED` 24 → **18**, the value in
      `camera-controller.ts`, so both hosts fly at the same speed. The strafe axis was also wrong and is
      now prod's: `right = forward × up` = `(−cos yaw, 0, sin yaw)` — ArrowRight used to strafe the wrong
      way. ARROWS move, the mouse look is the shared yaw/pitch; PgUp/PgDn lift (an engine addition — prod's
      fly camera has no vertical key, and a photo camera wants one).
- [x] 5.3 K+M chord — prod's state machine extracted as `createChordWatcher` (fires ONCE while both keys
      are held, re-arms only after a release; key repeat cannot re-fire it), unit tested. F2 drops the photo
      camera; **pausing drops it too** (with the pointer-lock release that was already there).
- [x] 5.4 HUD gained the chord line: `F2 = debugger · K+M = photo camera (ARROWS move, PgUp/PgDn lift,
mouse looks)`.
- [x] 5.5 Verified headless: chord ON → the frame changes completely (RMSE 0.26 vs the follow shot) while
      the player HUD coords stay at `2495.0, −1675.0, 13.3`; chord OFF → the follow rig returns
      (RMSE 0.036 vs the original — clock text only); flying high then F2 → back on the follow rig, and the
      debugger's Player screen agrees (`Fly Mode On` = it is off). **Bonus parity that fell out of reusing
      prod's `'fly-camera'` event: the game HUD (clock/zone) hides itself in photo mode**, because the
      shared `<Hud>` already listens for it — one emit, zero new code.

### Phase 6 — pointer capture button — SHIPPED 2026-07-18

- [x] 6.1 Prod's `sa-capture` "Click to play" button ported into `EngineCanvasHost` verbatim — same class
      (so the shell CSS already styles it), `locked` state from `pointerlockchange` compared against THIS
      canvas, hidden while locked, while paused, or before the world is up.
- [x] 6.2 The existing canvas-click lock stays (the button is the affordance, not the only path); Esc /
      pause still release the lock, and pause now also drops the photo camera (phase 5).
- [x] 6.3 Verified headless: visible at boot (screenshot shows CLICK TO PLAY centred over Ganton) ·
      hidden while the pointer is locked · back when the lock is released · hidden while paused (Esc opens
      the pause menu, HUD reads `PAUSED`). **Harness note:** headless Chromium refuses a real pointer lock,
      so the locked/unlocked branch was driven by stubbing `document.pointerLockElement` and dispatching
      `pointerlockchange` — that exercises OUR rule; the request path is prod's code unchanged.

### Close-out of phases 1–6

- [x] 7.1 The ritual display sweep — **user-run `?bench=all` on both renderers, 2026-07-18**, recorded in
      [bench/series.md § 22·debug-tools](bench/series.md). Engine: all six scenes vsync-locked, avg
      8.33–8.41 ms / p95 ≤ 9.4 (118.9–120.1 fps), draws 11–1 069, `lateCreates` 0. Prod (`?engine=three`,
      same 841-car population): 16.7–38.8 fps on land, 4 252–10 078 draws. Frame ratio 3.1–7.2×.
      **The overlay costs nothing while closed** — the engine rows match the pre-port C1 rows (8.32–8.33
      then, 8.33–8.41 now, inside noise).
- [x] 7.2 Series row written (with the honest tail: the residual 20–54 ms hitches are Rapier step time at
      ~1 000 bodies / 5 378 colliders, not the renderer; one 22.8 ms collision-cell spike; residency
      ≈1.6–1.7 GB at 2× with 841 cars). Bucket D stays a POST-FLIP batch for the user to pick from.
- [x] 7.3 **Remind the user: parity screenshots → THE FLIP.** Done — the user signed parity off («паритет
      ок») and [10-flip-decision](10-flip-decision.md) was written 2026-07-18; C2 followed the same day.

## Audit reference (2026-07-17) — the four buckets

### Bucket A — carries AS-IS (renderer-agnostic; Phase-2 wiring)

| Screen   | Controls                                         | Engine-host reality today                                               |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Player   | fly mode, respawn, to-Ganton, break nearest prop | breakables EXIST (B7); fly/respawn/teleport need `DebugActions` impls   |
| Vehicles | filter + spawn any vehicles.ide model, flip      | vehicle system EXISTS (B5, worker builds); spawn/flip need action impls |
| Time     | presets + 0–1439 slider                          | engine host has `hour` — trivial                                        |
| Weather  | timecyc weather list                             | `WeatherTransition` already wired (6 s blend, `[`/`]` keys) — trivial   |
| Position | city label, coords, copy, teleports              | teleport = the bench `teleportPlayer` path — trivial                    |
| Camera   | 8 follow sliders + wheel-zoom toggle             | same `camera.*` config — verify live re-read                            |
| ProcObj  | per-category enabled/drawDistance/density        | engine clutter uses the SAME scatter — verify config reaches it live    |

### Bucket B — already flows through the env driver (works once the overlay mounts)

`graphics.bloom.{enabled,intensity,threshold}` · `graphics.sun.godrays` · `graphics.sky.mood` ·
`graphics.sky.pbrExposure` · `graphics.clouds.opacity` · `graphics.night.emissiveBoost` ·
`graphics.night.litFade.*` (4 sliders) · `graphics.night.skylight` · `graphics.moon.brightness` ·
`graphics.worldLight.{dayBrightness,nightPrelitBrightness}` · `graphics.toneMapping` (on/off) ·
`graphics.vehicleReflection.{preset='off',intensity}` · `fog.timecycScale`. **All verified with metered
screenshots in phase 3.1** — and that pass is what caught the driver reading `night.litFade` / `fog.timecycScale`
only once at boot.

### Bucket C — hidden on the engine host, with their DISPOSITION (phase 4.2 — user reviews before C2)

`retire` = dies with the three path at C2 (plan 13) · `plan 17` = comes back with the map-lighting round ·
`needs feature` = the engine would have to grow something first · `0.6.0` = an idea-cycle plan owns it.

## Phase 7 — the Map screen RESTORED on the engine host (2026-07-19)

Plan 13 phase 5 recorded the Map screen as a deliberate loss ("three-host only; the engine host never had
them"). The user's verdict on the rebuilt debugger: it was **the most important element**, so it comes back.

**What was there** (recovered verbatim from `a312f0d^`): `map-inspector.tsx` (241 lines) — the region-coloured
SECTION grid with per-cell checkboxes, "Whole map", "Show LODs", a COLLISION toggle and a SELECTED panel
(name/txd/pos/mat + Hide object / Restore all) — plus `MapScreen` and `DrawDistanceControls` inside
`debug-overlay.tsx`.

**What survived the deletion**, and made this cheap: the `'map'` screen union member, the `Map` menu row, the
`mapScreen` capability + its `menuFor` filter, and **every** grid style in `debug-styles.ts` (`CELL_PX`, `cell`,
`cellCenter`, `cellEmpty`, `grid`, `sectionsBox`, `legend`, `swatch` …) — dead but intact. Only the components
and the render branch had gone.

### Shipped

- **`StreamingDriver.listCells()` + `setManualCells(cells, lod)`** — the driver's public surface was
  `unloadAll()` + `update()` and nothing else. The pin is injected at `desiredLevel()`, so the rings are
  BYPASSED rather than the update loop suspended: creates keep their frame budget and the atomic HD↔LOD swap
  still applies, and a pinned set fills in over a few frames instead of hitching. **Gotcha found by test:** the
  evict branch is guarded by the RING margin, so an unselected cell sitting under the camera would never
  unload — deselecting one would leave it on screen forever. Eviction now also fires whenever a pin is active.
- **`StreamSetup.cellSize`** — the inspector's grid maths needs the PAK's pitch, and `setup.ts` was computing
  it and throwing it away. It is the truth over the runtime config's copy, which a pak converted at another
  size would contradict.
- **`MapGame`** — the inspector's host contract, declared in `map-inspector.tsx` (the three `Game` class it
  used to take no longer exists). Selection members are OPTIONAL: a host without picking omits them and the
  SELECTED panel explains itself instead of showing dead buttons.
- **Host wiring** — `debugRef.mapGame`: `listCells`/`setManualCells` straight to the driver, `viewCell` from
  the player position, and `setMapViewer` reusing the existing photo camera (`setFlyMode`) plus the shared
  `'map-viewer'` event the HUD already listens for. `topDownView` was a stub returning `undefined`; it now
  lifts the detached eye 400 u over the player and pitches down (stopping 0.01 rad short of vertical — a
  perfectly vertical forward vector is degenerate for the look-at basis).
- **New capability `meshOverrides`** — Show Normals / Show Faces are three material overrides needing a debug
  world-pipeline variant, so they are gated OFF separately rather than dragging the whole screen down with
  them. `mapScreen` flips to `true` for the engine.
- **`DrawDistanceControls` restored unchanged** — it needed no engine work at all: `streaming()`,
  `setStreaming()`, `fogDistance()`, `setFogDistance()` were all already live on the engine actions.

6 new driver tests (pin ignores the rings · the pin LOADS its cell even outside the ring · a pinned level the
pak lacks · deselect evicts under the camera · the pin clears back to focus streaming · listCells dedups
levels); the two capability tests that asserted the Map
screen DROPS for the engine were updated — the behaviour intentionally changed. Suite 2266/321 green.

### Still open — picking (the selection half)

`WorldObjectInfo` selection is NOT wired, because cells are welded, material-batched geometry recorded once
into an immutable `GPURenderBundle`, with no per-vertex id channel and no model name anywhere in the cell
data. The `objectTable` is not an identity table — it holds only unmergeable objects (timed/breakable/
animated/roadsign/uvScroll) and its `params` is an animation slot, not an id.

**The agreed route (user, 2026-07-19) is an auxiliary MAPPER in the format, and the user will rebuild for it.**
The pattern already exists in miniature: `OscellBreakable {keyHash, indexOffset, indexCount}` gives per-
placement identity for smashables, and `CellStore.breakPlacement()` already hides one placement by degenerating
its indices with a single `writeBuffer`. Generalising that table to ALL placements (`nameRef` into a string
table + `indexOffset/indexCount` + an AABB) buys the whole SELECTED panel: pick = CPU ray against the
placements' AABBs in visible cells (no BVH, no ID-buffer readback), hide = the existing `breakPlacement`,
restore = re-upload the cell's original indices. Note `breakPlacement` has no inverse today, and `indexData`
is retained only for cells that carry breakables — restore has to solve that.

---

## Phase 8 — the placement MAPPER in the format (2026-07-19)

Phase 7 left the SELECTED panel unwired because welded cells have no per-object identity. The user chose the
mapper route and accepted the rebuild it costs.

**The insight that made it cheap:** the identity is not lost during the weld, only unrecorded. `OscellBreakable
{keyHash, indexOffset, indexCount}` already does this for smashables, and `CellStore.breakPlacement()` already
hides one by degenerating its indices. The mapper is that table generalised to every placement.

### `.oscell` minor 6

`OscellPlacement {id, nameRef, txdRef, indexOffset, indexCount, bounds[6]}` — 40 B/row — plus a per-cell name
pool (`Oscell.names`). One row per (part × instance × bucket), sharing an `id` (the SAME FNV-1a placement hash
the breakable table and the physics colliders use, so rows cross-reference either). Each row carries its OWN
AABB: a box around the whole model would swallow its neighbours on a pick.

Header count appended under `minor >= 6`, table appended after the breakables, pool last and written only when
rows reference it — the established rule, so a pre-mapper pak reads as "no placements" and the Map screen just
does not pick.

**The trap this rule exists for, and it bit immediately:** `oswire.ts` re-parses the header independently to
find the payload sections (`r.seek(68 + (minor >= 2 ? 4 : 0) + …)`). The new count shifted every wire offset
and two wire tests failed. The comment there warns about exactly this; the `minor >= 6` term is now in it.

### The welder

`WeldPlacementRange` mirrors `WeldBreakableRange` and is filled by a shared `recordRanges()`; bounds come from
exactly the vertex rows that append produced. `buildPlacementTable()` resolves bucket-relative starts to
absolute offsets (only the layout knows where a bucket landed), interns names, and MERGES rows of the same
placement that ended up adjacent in the final index buffer — a five-material building placed 40 times would
otherwise be 200 rows. The mapper rides BOTH levels, because "Show LODs" must still answer what was clicked.

### The engine

`CellStore.debugPicking` (default OFF) gates BOTH parsing the mapper and retaining `indexData`. This is the one
real design decision: a full map's mapper is tens of MB and the heap is 21 MB today, so paying for it in play
would undo the residency work. It takes effect on the next load, which entering the map viewer forces with
`unloadAll()`.

- `pick(origin, direction)` — ray/AABB slab test over the rows of every VISIBLE cell, nearest wins. No BVH, no
  ID-buffer readback; neither is possible on batched geometry with no per-vertex id. A ray starting INSIDE a
  box hits at 0 (clicking while stood inside a building selects it).
- `hidePlacement(id)` — `breakPlacement`'s degenerate-index trick on a mapper row, with the same 4-byte
  alignment rule (an unaligned `writeBuffer` is REJECTED with only a warning — a u16 range starting on an odd
  index would silently refuse to hide).
- Restore needs no inverse and no extra memory: the host calls `driver.unloadAll()` and the pinned set
  re-streams, rebuilding index buffers straight from the pak. That is already `breakPlacement`'s documented
  restore story, and SA's.

### The host

A click in the map viewer PICKS instead of grabbing the pointer, along the camera's forward vector — the
crosshair, not a cursor: the viewer flies with the mouse steering the look, so unprojecting a cursor position
would be wrong the moment the pointer locks. The hit is emitted as `'select'` with the position converted back
to GTA coords (engine `(x, y, z)` → `(x, −z, y)`), which is what the map files use and therefore what the panel
should show.

### Tests — 15 new, suite 2281/321 green

Format: mapper + name-pool round-trip FIELD BY FIELD (a rotation inside a reader is what cost a round on the
breakable table), a bad AABB throws, a pre-mapper cell reads clean. Welder: every placement named, ranges
inside the buffer, one id and one box per instance 10 u apart as placed, and **the mapper covers every triangle
in the cell exactly once** — a gap is an unpickable object, an overlap means two objects claim the same
triangles. Engine: picking off ⇒ no hits at all; ray beside/behind the boxes misses; frontmost wins; the
**cell ORIGIN is applied** (cell-local bounds would pick the wrong district); inside-the-box hits at 0; a
hidden placement stops picking while its neighbour survives.

### Owed after the user's rebuild

The pak-size delta. Estimate only, to be replaced with the measured number: 40 B/row after merging, so a cell
with ~2 000 rows adds ~80 KB, and a full map lands in the tens of MB against a 1.4 GB pak. `weldStats.placements`
reports the row count per cell and rides the existing convert report.
