# Plans index

The map of planning docs across the repo. **Engine plans** live here — one numbered folder per plan
(`docs/plans/NNN-*/readme.md`, multi-part plans add sibling files inside their folder); the
**offline tools** keep their own `docs/plans/` next to their code. Open questions and parked ideas live in
[`../open-issues/`](../open-issues/) and [`../ideas/`](../ideas/).

> **Before writing one, check [`docs/restrictions/`](../restrictions/README.md).** It holds the rules a
> design has to satisfy — layer boundaries, format ceilings, engine splits, what is decided at build time and
> cannot be re-taken at runtime — and says for each whether a violation is caught or is SILENT. A doc that
> violates one is not ambitious; it is a doc that gets rewritten after the first build.

> The [Nx monorepo migration (plan 057)](./057-nx-monorepo-migration/readme.md) will move each tool's `docs/` under
> `tools/<name>/docs/` — update the links below when it lands.

## Engine (`docs/plans/`)

Core runtime + RenderWare parsing, world streaming, rendering, characters, vehicles, physics, UI — plans
`001`–`099`, one folder each (066, 073, 074, 078–082, 096–099 carry multi-part sub-plans; 083 kept its
row but its chain was superseded by 097). Newest first:

- **[100 — 2dfx survives to LOD range](./100-2dfx-at-lod-range/readme.md)** — **PLANNED 2026-08-07**:
  chimney smoke, street lamps and street-name plates die at the HD boundary (`HD_RADIUS` 380), so a
  district past ~440 u draws to 1000 u dark, smokeless and unsigned. Both LOD generators bake the three
  types that have a consumer (0 light, 1 particle, 7 roadsign) and `cell-weld` starts reading what the cell
  bake produces — the half that makes the other half real, since nothing reads a cell LOD's 2dfx today. Also
  fixes the flat `DRAW_DISTANCE = 300` that overrides every fx system's authored `cullDist`. Step 00 is the
  research: it began as a killed plan (postmortem) and was revived the same day by a reversed decision.
  The six types our engine does not consume (16 934 stock entries) stay out of the OpenSA line — escalators
  among them, because our engine has no escalator code at all, while real SA implements them natively and the
  SA clones keep carrying the entry.
- **[099 — UV animations on script objects](./099-script-object-uv-anim/readme.md)** — **DONE
  2026-08-07** (planned 2026-08-05 from the 097/07 field bug round): the ferris wheel's blinking bulbs
  are a UVAnimDict step animation (`f13d`, a 13-frame film strip stepping every 0.225 s) that the
  world's kind-4 lane already played but the rigid/script-object path ignored. Baked the animation
  through (builder → `.osm` fixture, model-local list + per-submesh slot), added the rigid UV-anim lane
  (per-model uniform, identity slot 0, dynamic offsets — unbundled draws, so no bundle staleness; zero
  allocation and zero per-frame writes for models without animations), and the user's own rebuild +
  field run closed it: **the wheel blinks**. The edge-cases row is removed — the limitation is lifted.
  Open: the bench guard was never run, so "zero cost" is proven CPU-side only (099/02 ledger).

- **[098 — All land vehicle types](./098-all-land-vehicles/readme.md)** — **PLANNED 2026-08-04**,
  supersedes `roadmap/0.5.0/plans/04-all-vehicle-types/` (deleted). Rewritten from a four-way recon
  (data pipeline / physics / animation / docs) + the `NO_COMMIT/all-veh` corpus (the VSA Editor's
  15-class special-ability catalogue; a control mod car). The recon overturned the old chain's two
  pillars: 081/07's class-preset seed shipped EMPTY by measurement, and bikes fail on NAMES and
  PLUMBING before physics — `wheel_front`/`wheel_rear` match no regex (zero wheels baked), the 13 `!`
  bike-handling rows and the 30 `^` anim-group rows are parsed away, the ride IFPs sit in the
  deliberately-unexpanded `anim/anim.img`, and the repo contains ZERO Rapier joints (trailer hitch is
  greenfield). Eight sub-plans, four field checkpoints (it rides → it looks ridden → it tows → it
  bounces): data foundations → features module (pop-up lights generalised into a token registry —
  hydraulics, hooks, moving `misc_*` parts become data) → two-wheel balance controller on the authored
  `!` rows → rider animation → first joints/towing → abilities → per-class gameplay → audit close-out.
  Air/water/rail findings parked in `roadmap/0.6.0/plans/05-air-water-rail/`.

- **[097 — CLEO basic](./097-cleo-basic/readme.md)** — **CLOSED: 01–08 DONE 2026-08-06** (all three field checkpoints — the wheel spins, the corpus ships through pmb + fetch pack with nothing hand-placed; 07 closed with the tracer, the F2 CLEO screen, tiers-as-data + CI joins, audit + benchmarks, and CLEO is ON BY DEFAULT — `?cleo=0` opts out; 08 authoring SDK executed as the project-local chain `cleo/sdk/docs/plans/` — hello-conformance proven on BOTH runtimes, real CLEO included), supersedes the deferred
  `roadmap/0.5.0/plans/08-cleo-basic/` chain (deleted; it was the unstarted 083 rethink). Rewritten from a
  full recon: all seven target `.cs` scripts (`NO_COMMIT/cleo`) were disassembled — three mod classes
  (world objects / vehicle-part animation via native calls / ped-task orchestration), ~116 unique opcodes,
  and a native surface of only ~15 SA 1.0 addresses. CLEO becomes its own layer (`packages/cleo`:
  core decoder / VM / host contract / **native atlas** — memory and exe calls served as an
  object-capability facade over `VehicleHandle`, not byte emulation). Seven sub-plans with three field
  checkpoints (wheel spins → ladder/door/tracks → full build); also fixes mod-installer's silent `.cs`
  deletion on the bake path. Dedicated tooling sub-plan: `scm-disasm` / `cleo-census` / `cleo-run`.

- **[096 — Video mode](./096-video-mode/readme.md)** — **SHIPPED 2026-07-30/08-01, all eight phases**
  (road graph + seeded routes, autopilot, director + shot table, surveyed tripod stations, the region
  sequencer, the build-time mod-car ledger, the walk + flythrough scenes that complete D3's program, and the
  close-out: [audit](../audit/video-mode-096.md) + [benchmark](../benchmarks/opensa-engine/2026-08-01-headless-video-mode.json),
  a 32.7-minute unattended soak of 40 scenes with **0 throws and no drift**, and a per-frame cost of
  **0.0096 ms** — under 0.2 % of a 120 Hz frame. **Field-accepted 2026-08-01**: the user watched the walk and
  flythrough scenes and they look good, which is the one acceptance a headless run could never give).
  Planned the same day it was researched and graduated from
  `docs/ideas/video-mode/`; the user's decisions live in the readme's D-table, with three of them REVISED
  on 2026-07-31 — each revision written into its own row rather than over it. `?video=1` boots a bounded
  seeded self-directed showcase for trailer recording (scenes 1…100 of the seed, five cameras each): a random car (the build's OWN mod cars when it has any, via a new
  build-time `vehicle-installer` ledger) cruises a route generated from the game's own `NODES*.DAT`
  graph while cameras cut between occlusion-checked tripod stations and chase/front/rear/wing shots;
  walk and flythrough scenes; region cycle LS→LV→SF→Country→Desert; region-native weather, debugger
  time slots, black overlay between scenes, UI hidden. Eight phases, P0 = path graph + a closed-loop
  `PathFollowSource` autopilot on the shipped `InputState` path (the `?phys=` runner is the skeleton);
  the two field risks are autopilot cornering and cut flicker (the 080 multiray lesson). Deliberately
  NOT named "cinematic" — that is plan 080's word.

- **[095 — DFF geometry parity](./095-dff-geometry-parity/readme.md)** — SHIPPED 2026-07-30. Two converter
  bugs behind one field report ([forensics](../open-issues/fixed/mod-dff-winding-and-atomic-frame.md)): we
  built triangles from the Geometry Struct FACE ARRAY while RenderWare draws the BinMeshPLG index data (a
  mod's `roads32_law2` wound the two oppositely → the beach slab faced down and back-face culling deleted it,
  collision intact — the "blue strip"), and we applied the atomic's own frame transform, which
  `LoadAtomicFile` throws away for a simple map model (a mod's `land_42_sfw` rotated 90°, and 165 vanilla
  `aw_streettree1` had been sunk 3.1 m all along). Blast radius measured over all 13 003 archive DFFs: 5
  geometries change winding, 16 lose face-array faces the game never drew, 24 shift a few triangles between
  materials. Kept: `scan-geometry-parity.ts`, two new restriction entries, the stock-ADC (`bloodrb`/`rccam`)
  guard.

- **[094 — sa-map-viewer](./094-sa-map-viewer/readme.md)** — SHIPPED 2026-07-30 (phases 0–7; audit in
  [`audit/sa-map-viewer-094.md`](../audit/sa-map-viewer-094.md)). A standalone app rendering the map
  straight from a folder of ORIGINAL SA files (FSA picker or served dir): browser weld → the engine's
  own cell path, the debugger's `MapInspector` as a permanent panel, the map-viewer hand camera
  (pan/orbit/dolly) with fully param-specified scripted poses (no self-moving orbit — the blue-strip
  lesson), click-to-pick, model search with autocomplete that centres + activates the cell (the same
  search added to the in-game debugger via the `MapGame` contract), and the sea with a toggle. Its
  first field use bisected [`open-issues/fixed/mod-dff-winding-and-atomic-frame.md`](../open-issues/fixed/mod-dff-winding-and-atomic-frame.md),
  the issue it was born from, down to one placement.

- **[093 — The world ambient term](./093-world-ambient-term/readme.md)** — **CLOSED 2026-08-01**, field-confirmed
  for BOTH day (07-29) and night (08-01); nothing owed.
  SA's own building formula (recovered from SkyGfx's PS2 pipe + gta-reversed) adds
  `timecycle ambient × surfAmb` ON TOP of the day/night-blended prelight — an additive,
  normal-independent floor our `worldShade` never had. Without it every black-prelit vertex renders
  pure black, and the class is vanilla-wide (2 243 models, 125 of the worst 186 are stock SA — shadow
  was AUTHORED as black, trusting the renderer's floor). Engine half of map-optimizer plan 024;
  field-proven per-model with `model-repack.ts --prelit-floor` before a line of engine code changed.

- **[092 — Alpha classification: the cutouts that are not vegetation](./092-alpha-cutout-classification/readme.md)** —
  PLANNED 2026-07-29. The Watts Towers (`wattspark1_LAe2`) show their far side and the towers behind through
  the near one: their lattice textures carry **23.55 % mid-alpha** against `classifyAlpha`'s 2 % cutout
  bound, so they class `softBlend` → pipelineClass 2 → `world-blend-*`, which writes no depth. Identical to
  the trees-through-trees bug 074 fixed — except the fix upgrades softBlend → cutout for **vegetation defs
  only**, a rule that reads the slot instead of the asset. Census: 40 230 textures → 2 541 softBlend, of
  which 350 are true glass that must not move. **CLOSED, all four phases in one day.** The rule reads the
  histogram against the alpha TEST vanilla applies (`below ≥ 5 % ∧ above ≥ 5 % ∧ near ≤ 10 %`, the knee of
  the measured distribution) and moved **1 602** textures out of the blend pass; the pak ships 1 422 cutout
  / 661 soft-blend. The overlay class the texture cannot see is gated by `NO_ZBUFFER_WRITE`, **not**
  `DRAW_LAST` — the join found 1 359 DRAW_LAST defs on flipping txds and they are the TREES — and the
  reversed source later CONFIRMED that gate: SA answers a no-z-write model with alpha reference 0. Field:
  towers fixed, canopies and glass clean, sweep unchanged. Debt:
  [`hacks/alpha-mask-thresholds.md`](../hacks/alpha-mask-thresholds.md).
- **[091 — Frame-time attribution](./091-frame-time-attribution/readme.md)** — SHIPPED 2026-07-28, all three
  phases, no fix written. The `[slow]` line's `other` was a RESIDUAL holding two different things: untimed
  in-loop work, and everything the browser did BETWEEN frames — which **no in-loop timer can see**, and where
  a resolved spawn is paid. Phase 1 timed the four remaining in-loop groups (all ≤0.2 ms) and fixed two
  defects in the line itself: it mixed two intervals (a 25.1 ms block inside a 21.6 ms frame, residual −7.2)
  and it printed the 250 ms `dt` CLAMP, so the worst frame in the record read 250.0 when it was **576.1**.
  Phase 2 added a frame-span recorder (`packages/engine/src/debug/frame-spans.ts`) that between-frame work
  reports itself into. **Result: the spikes survived the `vehicle-model-builder` deletion, and the
  gameplay-relevant cost is per NEW car type — `.osm` parse worst 20.5 ms (`bus`) + GPU upload worst 18.2 ms
  (`tahoma`), ~25 ms in one frame; `unattributed` still holds 40–55 % of a spike and is GC-shaped.** Phase 3
  names the levers and waits on a field verdict.
- **[089 — Vehicle particles](./089-vehicle-particles/readme.md)** — CLOSED 2026-07-28, all five steps in
  one day (six field rounds): the dynamic one-shot particle lane + the engine's first DECAL lane, then
  tyre smoke, severity-darkened 12-real-second skid marks, impact smoke off the damage gate, and surface
  dust/sand by surfinfo's own `W_*` flags. Zero measurable sweep cost; every look number a documented
  eye-fit (`CFx` is stubs in gta-reversed). Audit:
  [`docs/audit/vehicle-effects-089.md`](../audit/vehicle-effects-089.md).
- **[088 — Ped locomotion feel](./088-ped-locomotion-feel/readme.md)** — SHIPPED 2026-07-24, both
  rounds: turn-rate heading + plant, crossfades with phase carry, walk/run/sprint tiers + cycle-speed
  sync, the jump/fall FSM (coyote/buffer/anticipation), impact-tiered landings, a real slope slide,
  and vehicle ingress/egress realism (root-motion slides, passenger door + shuffle, blockage-probed
  exit chain, overturned crawl-out, door choreography). Audit: `docs/audit/ped-locomotion-feel.md`.
- **[087 — The gostown field round](./087-gostown-field-round/readme.md)** — the first TC's field-bug
  batch after its first full boot (bridge at LOD range, missing island chunk + floating tree, black
  water stripes); same symptom→bytes method as 085.
- **[086 — One build, consistent names, pak-based fetch](./086-unified-build-naming-fetch/readme.md)** —
  `game-src/<id>` · `mods-src/<id>` · `build/<id>` naming unification (`original`→`original`,
  `build/original`→`build/original`), pak manifest identity, the fetch-pack finishing tool replacing
  `build-game.ts`, the fetch client booting the pak, TC trial runs (gostown/carcer/anderius).
- **[085 — Map-object appearance](./085-map-object-appearance/readme.md)** — the 2026-07-22 field round
  (after vehicles, before peds): row A SHIPPED — the night emissive mask went per-channel (the luma delta
  systematically killed saturated neon: the LV strip's red rope lights never glowed); further rows as the
  user reports them.

- **[084 — Vehicle appearance and dynamic-model lighting](./084-vehicle-appearance/readme.md)** — the 2026-07-20
  field round: wheel-side/scale conventions and the flat dynamic indirect term SHIPPED (with measurements);
  open = night level vs the map, reflections (floor vs prod-style presets — DECISION NEEDED) and AO for
  dynamics. The perf row is CLOSED (2026-07-21: it was mod vegetation, not vehicles). Peds share the
  row-B root.

- **083 — Basic CLEO support** — moved to 0.5.0 on 2026-08-01 unstarted, then **SUPERSEDED by
  [097](./097-cleo-basic/readme.md) on 2026-08-04** (the roadmap chain was rewritten against a full
  corpus recon and pulled back into active work; its folder is deleted). Promoted from ideas/0.4.0/04.
- **[082 — Vehicle license plates](./082-vehicle-plates/readme.md)** — per-instance city-correct plates on
  the array-based engine: plate atlas array + per-instance slot, converter-flagged plate submeshes,
  mask DSL + placement-seeded determinism, damage-riding. Promoted from ideas/0.4.0/01.
  **CLOSED 2026-07-28**: 01–04 shipped, the pak was reconverted and the field verdict is in — every car
  wears its plate. Phase 0 corrected two of this plan's own assumptions (the city mapping was recorded
  backwards, and a plate is two quads, not one), and the first real boot cost one fix: a WGSL uniformity
  error in `rigidTexel`, which no test can see. Closed on the look verdict — the distribution drive, the
  bench guard and a ram test are listed unmeasured in the plan's readme; **that unmeasured tail was deferred
  to 0.5.0 on 2026-08-01** (the plan itself stays here — it shipped in 0.4.0).
- **[081 — Vehicle driving physics](./081-vehicle-physics/readme.md)** — feel overhaul on the own engine.
  **01–05 DONE 2026-07-26, field-accepted**: `handling.cfg` went from 5 fields consumed to 21, every one a
  translation of the original's own code (spring law, `cTransmission` gearbox, air drag, tyre grip and
  traction loss, the steering limiter, the rear-lock handbrake); six fitted constants died; the gate is
  answered — STAY on DRCVC, its three asymmetries documented. Audit:
  [`audit/vehicle-physics-081.md`](../audit/vehicle-physics-081.md). **08 (SA gravity) closed-rejected and
  09 (speed steering) SHIPPED 2026-07-27**; the same day 07's regression pack (5 cars × 11 scenes, gated by
  `scripts/phys-regression.ts`) and its step-cost measurement landed, and 06 §2's kerb assist was closed by
  the field as not needed. **CODE-COMPLETE 2026-07-27**: 06 §1 air control (the original's own turn forces,
  `?airCtl`) and §3 camber from the authored axle, then 07's five-class sweep — which found the tuning
  generalises and left the class-factor table EMPTY — and the close-out
  ([audit](../audit/vehicle-physics-081-closeout.md)). **What is left is ONE field round** (jumps, a
  solid-axle car through a corner, one drive per class); 10 (surface types) is shipped-and-shelved as an
  open issue. Promoted from ideas/0.4.0/07.
- **[080 — Cinematic camera](./080-cinematic-camera/readme.md)** — GTA V-feel follow camera: per-channel
  springs/lag, auto-center + look-ahead, collision whiskers, vehicle speed/FOV/drift framing, bob/shake,
  7 sub-plans + priority chain. **01–07 DONE 2026-07-25** — the on-foot baseline, collision and the
  vehicle camera: damp/spring math + `CameraDirector` (`ui/camera/`), the smoothed rig with render
  interpolation (position weight), composition (turn-follow, idle recenter, look-ahead), collision
  (sphere casts, snap-in/ease-out, min distance, floor guard), and driving — speed→distance/FOV curves plus
  drift framing off 081/01's physics slip channel, as a second TUNING TABLE rather than a second code path,
  plus the additive motion layer — bob, landing dip, impact shake, sprint FOV kick, bounded and behind a
  `reducedMotion` switch (06). The 02–04 **field round is accepted** — defaults frozen as shipped, and the
  `?cam=legacy` A/B is DELETED with it. FOUR field rounds ran on the vehicle camera and the motion layer and
  every report was fixed; the close-out (07) turned the transition matrix into a test, froze the tuning,
  pruned the tab and ran the exit exam. **ACCEPTED in the field 2026-07-25 — the chain is closed for 0.5.0.**
  **08 (C-key view presets incl. first person) is DEFERRED**; its feasibility research is
  [`docs/ideas/first-person-camera/`](../ideas/first-person-camera/readme.md).
- **[079 — One canonical build source, the dev-surface unification, and its docs](./079-canonical-build-source/readme.md)**
  — every dev surface (lab, bench harness, viewers) reads ONE canonical build (`./build/original`), served in
  place (NOT copied into `public/`), via a new `http-dir` loader + the loading-MODE-selects-the-world fix +
  `buildTime`. Depends on [opensa-pack 003](../../tools/opensa-pack/docs/plans/003-game-shaped-output.md).
  **Phases 0–5 DONE 2026-07-21; phase 6 (docs) open.**
- **[078 — Global bug fixing](./078-global-bug-fixing/readme.md)** — the umbrella ledger for the bugs the
  first FULL pmb map convert surfaced (2026-07-19, >1 h run): engine and tool fixes tracked in one place.
  **OPEN — awaiting the detailed bug report; runs before 079.**
- **[077 — Unit coverage back to 85–90 %](./077-unit-coverage/readme.md)** — the 074/13 teardown deleted heavily
  unit-tested WebGL code and sank coverage 88.9 → 72.3 %. Recovered to **88.18 %** with a **device-independent
  seam**: a recording `GPUDevice` stand-in that boots the whole engine headlessly, no engine source touched.
  **DONE 2026-07-18.**
- **[076 — Roadsign / billboard text](./076-roadsign-text/readme.md)** — 2dfx type-7 text plates (roadsignfont glyph
  atlas, world-space) that prod renders and the own engine skips → blank boards. Bake into the cutout pipeline.

- **[075 — Water body classes: SEA vs INLAND](./075-water-body-classes/readme.md)** — split water.dat by height so
  inland pools/reservoirs render calm (no swell/foam/spillover) while the ocean keeps its full dynamics.

- **[074 — OpenSA engine](./074-opensa-engine/readme.md)** — own WebGPU-only framework + native formats
  (concept: [00-concept](./074-opensa-engine/00-concept.md)): target **60 fps with the full WebGL effect set**. Chain:
  01 framework architecture · 02 native formats (`.oscell`/`.ostex`/`.ospak`, texture ARRAYS, alpha pipeline) ·
  03 converter tool (`opensa-pack`) · 04 engine lab + P0 gate · 05 streaming/memory · 06 world effects ledger ·
  07 baked channels (066 specs re-targeted) · 08 dynamics (early skinning probe) · 09 post-FX/MSAA+A2C ·
  10 integration & flip. Vertical-slice roadmap M0–M4, every milestone gated on numbers.

- **[073 — WebGPU migration (three.js) — FAILED](./073-webgpu-migration-threejs/readme.md)** — the WebGL→WebGPU
  renderer mode on three.js: the CPU side was fully solved (render 65 → ~4 ms: bundles + patched three 0.185.1 +
  plain-Mesh pipeline sharing + memory caps), but an irreducible GPU/present remainder in **three's WebGPU
  backend on Metal** kept an M3 Pro under the 40 fps bar — the blocker is on three.js's side (per-object
  pipelines, naga codegen traps, backend present overhead; full forensic log in sub-plan 08). **Conclusion: the
  path forward is our own framework — [074 OpenSA engine](./074-opensa-engine/readme.md).** The
  `?webgpu/bundle/...` flags and engine changes stay in-tree for debugging until the own-framework work decides
  their fate.

- **[062 — Rendering overhaul](./062-rendering-overhaul/readme.md)** — **CLOSED 2026-07-21 (user triage): the whole
  062–072 chain is superseded by the own engine (074) — every effect was re-implemented there; no tail in
  these plans is actionable any more.** The "modern lighting" fork (chain umbrella,
  promoted from `ideas/0.4.0/02-rendering`): real sun on the prelit world without double-counting, CSM building
  shadows with LOD proxies, PBR sky + 512×1 horizon LUT, unified fog (horizon cut), Gerstner water, world-shader
  light pool (projected headlights), glowing night emissives, quality tiers + default flip. Stages:
  [063 foundations/instrumentation](./063-render-foundations-instrumentation/readme.md) ·
  [064 hybrid lighting](./064-hybrid-world-lighting/readme.md) · [065 shadows](./065-cascaded-shadows/readme.md) ·
  [066 pmb modern-asset tool](./066-pmb-modern-tool/readme.md) · [067 sky](./067-pbr-sky-clouds/readme.md) ·
  [068 fog](./068-unified-fog/readme.md) · [069 water](./069-water/readme.md) · [070 local lights](./070-local-lights/readme.md) ·
  [071 night](./071-night-emissive-atmosphere/readme.md) · [072 tiers/flip](./072-quality-tiers-default-flip/readme.md).
- [061 — World-ready state](./061-world-ready-state/readme.md) — boot reveal + teleport freeze driven by streaming
  `settled()`.
- [060 — Streaming smoothness](./060-streaming-smoothness/readme.md) — warm-invisibly + atomic-appear cell pipeline.
- [059 — Map car generators](./059-map-car-generators/readme.md) — spawn the binary-IPL `CARS` section (SA's map-baked
  parked cars in gta3.img): parser + specific-model + random (popcycle/cargrp, B1 city approximation) all done
  (lazy LOD register, ground-snap on spawn), in-game verified; B2 per-zone fidelity + random colour pending.
- [058 — Modloader](./058-modloader/readme.md) — `modloader/` overlay (`AssetFileSystem` decorator): override vehicle
  dff/txd + merge their settings into vehicles.ide/handling.cfg/carcols.dat, no engine changes. **REMOVED
  2026-07-28** — mods install at build time now; see
  [postmortem/runtime-modloader-overlay.md](../postmortem/runtime-modloader-overlay.md).
- [057 — Nx monorepo migration](./057-nx-monorepo-migration/readme.md)
- [056 — Multi-game config](./056-multi-game-config/readme.md)
- [055 — Input sources / mobile controls](./055-input-sources-mobile-controls/readme.md) · [054 — Asset cache revoke](./054-asset-cache-revoke/readme.md) · [053 — Asset local loader](./053-asset-local-loader/readme.md)
- …`001`–`052` in this folder.

## Tools (each ships its own plans)

- **map-optimizer** — lossless DFF/TXD conditioning (normals, prelit, dedupe, mips, full build).
  [`map-optimizer/docs/plans/`](../../tools/map-optimizer/docs/plans/) (`001`–`015`).
- **vehicle-optimizer** — scale + reflection-strength transfer for vehicle DFFs.
  [`vehicle-optimizer/docs/plans/`](../../tools/vehicle-optimizer/docs/plans/) (`001`–`003`).
- **opensa-lod-generator** — chunked LOD bake (merge → QEM decimate → per-cell TXD → drop-in build).
  [`opensa-lod-generator/docs/plans/`](../../tools/opensa-lod-generator/docs/plans/) (`001`–`002`).
- **lod-trees-generator** — SA-style tree LOD impostors (crossed-billboard cards + baked alpha atlas) from HD
  trees, plus the map strip + place stages (text↔binary IPL LOD-index coupling), the SA asset-format checklist,
  and aspect-aware atlas + `--prelight` trunk transfer. (procobj is now its own tool.)
  [`lod-trees-generator/docs/plans/`](../../tools/lod-trees-generator/docs/plans/) (`001`–`005`, `007`).
- **lod-procobj-generator** — procobj scatter → static IPL with **simplified-copy** (decimated) LODs; reuses
  `sa-lod` + `map-placement`. [`lod-procobj-generator/docs/plans/`](../../tools/lod-procobj-generator/docs/plans/)
  (`001` architecture · `002` build pipeline · `003` asset format).
- **mod-installer** — layer mod folders onto a base game (files overwrite, `gta3img/` merges into `gta3.img`, a
  PNG folder merges into a sibling loose `.txd`), alphabetical.
  [`mod-installer/docs/plans/`](../../tools/mod-installer/docs/plans/) (`001` design · `002` as-built · `003` txd).
- **vehicle-installer** — install vehicle mod folders: dff/txd → `gta3.img`; settings → `handling.cfg`/
  `vehicles.ide`/`carcols.dat` (car/car4, alpha-sorted, custom `col` palettes)/`carmods.dat`; `--strip` to keep
  only the installed cars. [`vehicle-installer/docs/plans/`](../../tools/vehicle-installer/docs/plans/) (`001`
  architecture · `002` install · `003` palette · `004` strip).
- **ped-installer** — install ped mod folders: dff/txd → `gta3.img`; a new ped's line → `peds.ide` (replace by
  model, append if new); `--strip` to keep only the installed peds + the player ped (`--player`, default
  `BMYPOL1`). [`ped-installer/docs/plans/`](../../tools/ped-installer/docs/plans/) (`001` architecture · `002`
  add/replace · `003` strip).
- **tool-kit** — shared building blocks (mesh smooth-normals + QEM simplify, editable IMG). No plans doc yet.
- **map-placement** — shared SA map-edit workflows (id allocation, IDE/gta.dat edits, swapped-HD retexture,
  procobj convert/strip), used by lod-trees-generator + lod-procobj-generator.
  [`map-placement/docs/plans/`](../../tools/map-placement/docs/plans/) (`001` architecture & API).
- **sa-lod** — shared simplified-copy LOD pipeline (decimate → normals → encode DFF/TXD/COL), extracted from
  opensa-lod-generator, used by it + lod-procobj-generator.
  [`sa-lod/docs/plans/`](../../tools/lod-common/docs/plans/) (`001` architecture & API · `005` the 2dfx
  keep-policy + `006` `transform2dfxEntry` — both SHIPPED 2026-08-07, arrived from roadmap 0.5.0 plan 07).
- **rw-codec** — shared pure RW chunk/DFF/DXT/geometry-struct/2dfx codec, extracted from map-optimizer
  (plan 057, step 2). [`rw-codec/docs/plans/`](../../tools/rw-codec/docs/plans/) (`001` typed 2dfx payload
  codecs — SHIPPED 2026-08-07, arrived from roadmap 0.5.0 plan 07).
- **timecyc-builder** — timecyc precompute. No plans doc yet.
- **cleo/scripts** — authored CLEO script sources on the SDK (runtime content, not a build tool — the
  `asi/perfect-map` root-category pattern). [`cleo/scripts/docs/plans/`](../../cleo/scripts/docs/plans/readme.md)
  (`001` rhino tracks — CLOSED 2026-08-07, both runtimes field-proven, shipping step waived ·
  `002` no_lights — PLANNED 2026-08-06).
