# 201/4 — A console is not a game: the session and the battery

A game's frame loop runs flat out because a game is always moving. A dispatch map is **idle for most of a
shift**, on a device that runs hot and goes flat. Nothing in the engine knows the difference yet: the console
redraws a static city at full rate to show a call queue that changed once a minute.

This is engine work both consumers get — the game's pause menu and its photo mode have exactly the same
shape.

## Steps

### 01 — Render on demand

Draw a frame when something changed: the camera moved, the board ticked, the hour crossed, a selection
changed, a cell finished streaming. Otherwise do not.

The trap to design against is the one the restrictions already name in another form — a decision taken on a
threshold gets retaken next frame
([architecture](../../../restrictions/architecture.md#a-framing-decision-taken-on-a-threshold-will-be-taken-again-next-frame)).
"Nothing changed" must be a state the frame can read, not an event it can miss, or the console stops
redrawing while something is still moving.

**Budget:** name the latency allowance for the first frame after an input **before** building it. A map that
saves battery and feels sticky under the thumb has failed.
**Owes:** idle draw calls → 0, the wake latency measured against that budget, and a battery/thermal delta
over a shift-length idle on the [2/03](../2-real-device-truth/readme.md) device.
**If a cheaper version is rejected** for a better-feeling one, it goes to
[`docs/performance/deferred-optimizations/`](../../../performance/README.md) with its price.

**BUILT 2026-08-22; the battery delta is owed by the [2/03](../2-real-device-truth/readme.md) device.**

**The budget, named before the build:** the first frame after an operator's input is the NEXT animation
frame — one frame at the display's rate, never one idle period. It is met by the pointer, wheel and key
handlers re-arming the fast schedule in their own handler, so the idle poll never sits between a thumb and
the picture. The poll's own period, **100 ms**, is the separate budget for a change nobody touched (a board
tick arriving from the feed): PCAD publishes every 4 s, so it is two orders of magnitude inside the rate the
data arrives at, and under the threshold at which a change stops reading as immediate.

**"Nothing changed" is a STATE, exactly as the step demanded.** `RenderGate` compares the whole picture's
inputs — pose in all six degrees of freedom, the board by identity, the selection, the hour, the drawing
buffer's size, the sketch revision, and the streamer's pending/created/evicted counters — against the frame
that last DREW. A signal that arrives while the loop is asleep is still there when it looks, because it is a
value rather than a notification. `wake()` exists only to make the answer arrive sooner; it is never how the
answer is found. **Stopping the loop entirely** — the cheaper version — is [priced and
refused](../../../performance/deferred-optimizations/idle-loop-stop.md): an event-driven wake is one
forgotten `wake()` away from a map that looks frozen, and that is a silent regression the day somebody adds
a twelfth source of change.

**It is in BOTH modes**, and deliberately so: plan mode is the fallback a weak device gets, and redrawing a
still plan sixty times a second is the last thing such a machine needs.

**What idle costs the world:** the picture freezes, sway and UV scrollers included, until the next change.
Nothing is cut — the [protected list](../1-the-map-profile/protected-list.md) is about what the build and
the frame carry, not about a still map — and the first input resumes all of it
([edge-cases](../../../edge-cases/dispatch-console.md)). If a field verdict says a frozen world reads as a
hung one, the lever is an idle RATE rather than an idle stop.

**The claim is readable rather than asserted:** the status bar shows `idle` in place of a frame rate, and
`?inventory=1`'s report carries **`framesSkipped`** beside `frames` — a capture with 400 frames and 0 skips
was taken on a moving map, one with 40 frames and 3 600 skips on a console at rest, and the two cannot be
compared without it.

**Still owed:** the wake latency measured under a thumb and the battery/thermal delta over a shift-length
idle, both on the 2/03 device.

### 02 — The long session

Residency drift and texture-array growth over hours of panning. The rule to watch:
[a texture array that GROWS invalidates every render bundle recorded against it](../../../restrictions/gpu-and-shaders.md)
— a game session ends, an operator's does not.

**Owes:** resident MB at t=0 / 30 min / 2 h on the [pinned district](../1-the-map-profile/readme.md), and the count of bundle re-records over that
window. A drift with no ceiling is a finding, not a footnote.

### 03 — The wait before the first frame

4/01 made the first frame cheap. This step is about the seconds BEFORE it, which on the phone were a black
rectangle: no signal that anything was happening, and no way to tell a slow pak from a crash.

Four pieces. Three were chosen with the user 2026-08-26 — progress only, no flat map and no skeleton behind
it — and the fourth came out of what they measured:

- **The boot shell.** Inline in `dispatch.html`, painted before the module graph, released on the first
  frame that has a PICTURE rather than when `bootDispatch` returns. Contract and failure shapes in
  [the feature doc](../../../features/dispatch-console.md).
- **The pak cache.** A second open of the same district should not re-read the pak over the network.
  Cache Storage, keyed by the manifest's `buildTime`, degrading silently where `caches` is undefined — a
  LAN `http://` origin is not a secure context and has none, though the phone's own `localhost` does.
  Counted as a subset of the traffic (`pakTraffic.cachedBytes`), never as a claim.
- **Async pipelines, and the split that checks them.** `engine-frame` measured **77.9 ms on the first frame
  in both 08-25 captures, to the tenth** — a fixed cost, now the largest item on that frame. The 34
  pipelines are compiled with `createRenderPipelineAsync` and awaited once, which shortens `engine.init`
  (`boot.gpuMs`) — and NOT, by itself, that 77.9 ms, because `compileAll` never ran inside a frame. So the
  first three frames are split by phase (`firstFrames` in the capture) and the number gets an owner before
  anything else is aimed at it.

- **The GPU and the network at the same time.** The capture below said `engine.init` costs **2 607.5 ms**
  with the radio idle — and only then did the world start looking for its manifest, its worker, its timecyc,
  its water and its district table, each behind the last. The pak's engine-free half is `openPakSource` now
  (manifest + a worker already probed onto its IO mode and slice cache), STARTED before `engine.init` is
  awaited and handed to `setupStreaming` as `opened`; the timecyc read goes beside it, and the water mesh and
  the district table are fetched together rather than in sequence. The boot pays `max` instead of `sum`, and
  the capture says how much of the two really overlapped (`boot.openMs`, `boot.overlapMs`) rather than
  claiming it. What it costs: a world that FAILS reports after the GPU is up instead of before it — and a GPU
  that fails leaves a worker the boot has to `terminate()`, since that session falls back to plan mode and
  keeps running. **Measured here:** the dispatch chunk goes **121.47 → 121.88 kB raw (41.51 → 41.70
  gzipped)** for the scheduling, the cleanup and the two counters; the engine chunk does not move.

**Measured 2026-08-26** ([the capture](../../../benchmarks/opensa-engine/2026-08-26-mobile-boot-split.json)):
the shell ran a real boot; the cache answered **10.67 MB of 32.68 over 59 of 88 requests**; and the split
named the 77.9 ms in one go — **`frame:sky-lut` 75.8**, fixed at 3.3x
([the bench](../../../benchmarks/opensa-engine/2026-08-26-sky-lut-build.json)).

**Three of the four owed numbers came back the same day**
([the capture](../../../benchmarks/opensa-engine/2026-08-26-mobile-boot-warm-second-open.json), a SECOND open
of the pinned district at street height):

- **The sky-LUT fix, on the device: `frame:sky-lut` 75.8 → 15.4 ms on the first frame, 4.9x** — more than the
  3.3x the desktop bench predicted — and the whole first frame goes **85.1 → 23.7 ms**.
- **The repeat open: the cache served 23.60 MB of 26.26 (89.9 %) over 40 of 41 requests**, against 33 % over
  59 of 88 when the open reached past what had filled it. The blob handler's mean halves with it (0.130 →
  0.065 ms). **The one miss is `water.bin`, to the byte** — a loose file beside the pak rather than a pak
  slice, so it is a miss by construction; whether those bytes crossed the network was not visible from the
  capture, and nothing there says they did. **It is visible now**: `installWater` reads Resource Timing's
  `transferSize` for that file and counts a hit only at 0 — a 304 carries bytes and counts as a miss, an
  entry Resource Timing cannot produce is not counted at all — so `cachedBytes` now means what did not cross
  the wire over both caches rather than over one of them.
- **`boot.gpuMs` 2 607.5 → 398.4, and it is claimed for NOTHING.** The only code difference between the two
  captures is the sky-LUT fix, which can own at most the 17.6 ms that `init:sky-lut` now reports. The split
  says where the rest of the boot lives — **`init:pipelines` 226.8, `init:device` 117.4**, resources 28.9,
  targets 4.9, canvas 2.0, 397.6 of 398.4 attributed — and leaves ~2.2 s with no owner between the two runs.
  **The standing hypothesis is the browser's persisted pipeline cache: warm on this open, cold on that one**,
  which would mean the boot this step is about — the FIRST one after an app rebuild — is still the 2.6 s run
  and is now unmeasured. It is a hypothesis and not a finding: the test is one capture with the site's data
  cleared against one taken straight after it, and it is cheap.

**The warm boot reproduced, and the third capture did too**
([the repeat](../../../benchmarks/opensa-engine/2026-08-26-mobile-warm-boot-repeat.json)): `boot.gpuMs`
**347.2** against 398.4 with `init:pipelines` **218.3** against 226.8 — a stable ~220 ms phase over two runs,
which makes 2 607.5 the outlier rather than the series. The second open reproduced with it (**22.26 MB of
24.92, 89.3 %, 38 of 39 requests**), and **`water.bin` missed again at exactly the same 2 658 756 bytes**.

**Still owed, and the reason is not the measurement:** the first `boot.overlapMs`. **Three captures in a row
were taken of the app from BEFORE the overlap landed** — the third after a `git pull` that printed
`no such ref was fetched` (the device's branch tracked a branch name the remote no longer has), did not
merge, **and exited 0**, so the archive that was re-extracted was the one already in the tree. Two of the
three were believed to be captures of something else, and only an accident gave the first away: that change
happened to ADD fields, and their absence showed. **A capture says which app it is now** — `app`, the commit
vite stamps in — and the trap is written up as
[a restriction](../../../restrictions/architecture.md), because it is silent in the worst way: nothing
errors, every number is real, and it is a real measurement of the wrong build.

Also owed: the cold/warm boot pair, which is what decides whether `init:pipelines` is a 220 ms phase or a
2.3 s one — neither run so far cleared the site's data, so the hypothesis is still untested.

## Verification

- The idle claim is read off a capture, not asserted: draws at rest, over a stated window.
- The wake latency is measured under the thumb, on the real device, and judged from the driver's seat as well
  as from the number — per
  [directive 4](../../../project-goals.md#4-better-must-be-demonstrated-not-assumed).
- The 2-hour session ends with the world still correct: cars and peds still drawn, the hour still turning
  (the [protected list](../1-the-map-profile/readme.md), re-read at the end of a long run rather than the
  start).
