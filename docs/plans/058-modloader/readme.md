# 058 — modloader: architecture, complexity & task plan

**Plan only — no code yet.** A SA-MTA-style **modloader**: a game tree may contain a `modloader/` folder whose
subfolders ship replacement vehicle `dff`/`txd` (+ optional settings `.txt`). The mod assets **override** the
stock ones by name, and the settings are **merged** into the base `vehicles.ide` / `handling.cfg` / `carcols.dat`
before the engine reads them — **without touching the engine** (`packages/game`).

Scope (phase 1, done): **vehicles only**, settings = `vehicles.ide` line + `handling.cfg` line + `carcols.dat`
line. Duplicate-file conflict resolution is out of scope. **Phase 2 (planned, below): map/asset mods** — new
defs/placements/collision/`txdp` via a gta.dat-style loader file (loads our `lod-trees`/`lod-procobj` `--modloader`
output + community map mods). See "Extension (planned)".

## How the engine reads vehicles today (measured)

`GtaSaWorldAdapter` (`packages/game/src/adapters/gta-sa-world.adapter.ts`):

- **DFF/TXD** — `loadVehicle(model)` does `requireBuffer(fs, '<model>.dff')` (and the same for `.txd`). It reads
  the **bare** archive name (the key gta3.img / the raw install populate). There is no loose `vehicles/` folder —
  the roster comes from `vehicles.ide`. So serving a `<model>.dff` override under that **same bare key** shadows
  the stock model with zero ambiguity.
- **Settings** — `ensureVehicleData()` (lazy, on the first `loadVehicle`, then cached) reads three **text** files
  via the VFS and parses them:
  - `requireText(fs, 'data/vehicles.ide')` → `parseVehicleDefs` (keyed by **model name**, the `cars` section).
  - `requireText(fs, 'data/carcols.dat')` → `parseCarcols` (keyed by **model name**).
  - `requireText(fs, 'data/handling.cfg')` → `parseHandling` (keyed by **handling id**, uppercase).

So overriding a vehicle = (a) serve its `dff`/`txd` under the bare `<model>.*` key, and (b) make those three text
files, **as the VFS returns them**, contain the mod's line for that vehicle. The VFS is a flat, synchronous,
last-write-wins key→bytes store (`@opensa/vfs`) and `AssetFileSystem extends ImgArchive` — i.e. the thing the
engine reads through is just an interface we can **decorate**.

## The example (`./1`)

```
modloader/
  admiral - 1976 Mercedes-Benz 230 - k1real24/
    admiral.dff   admiral.txd   admiral.settings.txt
  alpha - …/   alpha.dff  alpha.txd  alpha1.txd … alpha4.txd  alpha.settings.txt
```

The folder layout is **irrelevant** — like the real Modloader, files may sit at the root of `modloader/` or be
nested any number of levels deep. `<name>.dff`/`.txd` match the stock gta3.img names (a mod may ship several
txds — each overrides by its own name). `*.settings.txt` bundles **three lines** (blank-line
separated), each from a different stock file:

```
416, 	ambulan, ambulan, car, AMBULAN, AMBULAN, van, ignore, 10, 0, 0, -1, 0.82, 0.82, -1   ← vehicles.ide cars line
AMBULAN  3500.0 14000.0 4.0 …                                                                ← handling.cfg line
ambulan, 1,3                                                                                  ← carcols.dat car line
```

The settings file may be **absent** (→ keep stock settings) or **partial** (only some of the three blocks).
Real mods often carry **extra** blocks the merge ignores — notably a tuning/extras parts list (`model, part,
part, …`), which is dropped because its comma values aren't numeric palette indices (else it would be mistaken
for the carcols line and paint every spawn white). The carcols block may also be **4-colour** (`model,
c1,c2,c3,c4, …`, e.g. broadway) → merged into the `car4` section (and the model removed from `car`, so a stock
2-colour entry can't shadow it).

## Design — a thin `AssetFileSystem` decorator (between VFS and the engine)

A new runtime package **`@opensa/modloader`** (`type:engine`), one entry point:

```ts
withModloader(vfs: AssetFileSystem): AssetFileSystem
```

It wraps the VFS so the engine reads through it transparently — **no change to `packages/game`**. Wiring is a
single line where the app hands the fs to the engine (`new Game({ fs: withModloader(vfs) })`).

At construction (eager, synchronous — the VFS is sync):

1. **Scan** `vfs.names` for any file under `modloader/` (at any depth — folders are ignored): every `.dff`/`.txd`
   and every `*.settings.txt`.
2. **Override map** — each `.dff`/`.txd` → its bytes, keyed by its **bare file name** (shadows gta3.img for
   `loadVehicle`, which reads the bare `<model>.dff` / `<txd>.txd`).
3. **Settings** — parse each `*.settings.txt`, split into blocks, **classify** each block by feeding it to the
   existing parsers (`parseVehicleDefs('cars\n…\nend')`, `parseHandling(…)`, `parseCarcols('car\n…\nend')`) — the
   one that parses cleanly tags the block. Collect per-vehicle `{ ideLine?, handlingLine?, carcolsLine? }`.
4. **Merged texts** — build override strings for `data/vehicles.ide` / `data/handling.cfg` / `data/carcols.dat`:
   take the base text and **replace** each overridden vehicle's line in place (by model / handling-id key,
   section-aware), inserting if absent. (Same section-aware line-edit discipline as the `lod-trees` IDE/IPL
   editors.) Only build a merged string for a file that an override actually touches.

Reads:

```ts
get(name)     → overrideBytes.get(name) ?? vfs.get(name)
getText(name) → mergedText.get(name)    ?? vfs.getText(name)   // the 3 vehicle data files
has / names   → union of the override keys with the VFS
```

Everything is precomputed once, so reads stay O(1) and synchronous (the engine's contract).

### Module shape

```
packages/modloader/src/
  index.ts          withModloader(vfs)
  scan.ts           scanModloader: walk modloader/** → { overrides: bare-name→bytes, settings: parsed[] }
  settings.ts       parse a .settings.txt → { ideLine?, handlingLine?, carcolsLine? } (classify via the parsers)
  merge-ide.ts      replace a cars-section line by model in vehicles.ide
  merge-handling.ts replace a line by handling-id in handling.cfg
  merge-carcols.ts  replace a car-section line by model in carcols.dat
```

Depends on `@opensa/renderware` (the three parsers + `AssetFileSystem`/`ImgArchive` types) and `@opensa/vfs` only
for the type. No engine, no loader code.

## Prerequisite — getting `modloader/` into the VFS (turned out **free**)

The decorator reads `modloader/**` from the VFS as loose entries — and **both loaders already ingest them**, no
change needed:

- **fetch build** — `scripts/build-game.ts` `walk(src)` walks the **whole** game tree, excluding only the model
  archives + `anim.img`, and buckets every other file by `looseGroup` (`.dff`→models, `.txd`→textures, `.txt`→
  others). So `modloader/**` is packed + keyed by its lowercased relative path.
- **local loader** — `selectInstallEntries` returns `loose: source.looseFiles()` = **all** loose files (anything
  not an `.img` archive), so `modloader/**` flows straight into the VFS.

So the only change outside the package is the **one-line app wiring**.

## Complexity estimate — **Medium, low-risk**

| Part                                                 | Effort      | Notes                                                                                 |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `withModloader` decorator + override map (dff/txd)   | **Low**     | sync wrap; `loadVehicle` reads the bare `<model>.dff`/`<txd>.txd` the overlay shadows |
| Scan `modloader/**` from the VFS                     | **Low**     | string ops over `vfs.names`                                                           |
| Parse + classify `.settings.txt` blocks              | **Low–Med** | reuse the 3 existing parsers to validate/classify; handle partial/absent              |
| Merge into vehicles.ide / handling.cfg / carcols.dat | **Med**     | 3 section-aware line-replace editors (same pattern as the lod-trees IDE/IPL editors)  |
| Ingest `modloader/**` into the VFS                   | **Low–Med** | small additions to `build-vfs.ts` + `build-game.ts` (loader/build, not engine)        |
| Wiring (`withModloader(vfs)` at the fs boundary)     | **Trivial** | one line in `apps/web`                                                                |
| Tests                                                | **Med**     | settings classify, the 3 merges, the decorator override + passthrough                 |

**No engine changes.** The only friction is the 3 text-merges (small, well-trodden) and the loader/build ingestion
of `modloader/`. Roughly a focused day or two.

## Task plan (phases)

1. **Scaffold** `@opensa/modloader` ✅ (package + symlink + nx `type:engine`; vitest/eslint via the `packages/**`
   globs — no special override, the package is pure browser TS).
2. **Settings parse/classify** ✅ — `settings.ts`: split blank-line blocks, structural guess + validate with the
   real parser; a handling line needs ≥ 20 fields (so prose isn't taken for handling). Tests on the `./1` example.
3. **Three merges** ✅ — `merge.ts`: `mergeIde` (cars section, model col 1) · `mergeCarcols` (car section, col 0) ·
   `mergeHandling` (flat car table, first token; comments/`!`/`$` sub-tables left alone). Replace-in-place, append
   new before `end`. Tested (replace, leave others, append).
4. **Decorator** ✅ — `index.ts` `withModloader(fs)` (+ `scan.ts` `scanModloader`): scan `modloader/**` (any depth),
   build the bare `<file>.dff|txd` override map + merged `vehicles.ide`/`handling.cfg`/`carcols.dat`; `get`/`getText`/
   `has`/`names` overlay, everything else passes through. Returns the same fs when there's no overlay. Tested.
5. **Ingestion + wiring** ✅ — ingestion was already free (both loaders pull `modloader/**` in as loose files).
   Wired `withModloader(vfs)` in `apps/web/.../use-asset-boot.ts`: once the VFS is loaded (`phase === 'warmup'`+),
   the returned `fs` is the modloader overlay (memoised once per loaded session, stable ref). No engine change.
6. **Verify** — _pending the user_: drop the `./1` modloader into a game tree, load, confirm the modded
   admiral/ambulan render with merged handling/colours.

## Open / out of scope

- Duplicate files across modloader subfolders (which wins) — **out of scope** (user-deferred); for now, last-scan
  or first-scan wins, undefined.
- **New** vehicles (not stock) — needs a free object id + full `cars`/handling/carcols rows; the examples are all
  stock overrides, so assume **override-only** (keep the stock id). New-vehicle id allocation is a later add.
- Non-vehicle objects, other settings (e.g. `vehicles.col`, mod-specific textures beyond the car txd) — later.
- Where exactly the app wraps the fs (`use-asset-boot` / `canvas-host`) — confirm the single call site.

# Extension — map/asset mods (`loader.txt` + IDE/IPL/COL/txdp)

**Status: ✅ Implemented (decorator); in-game verify pending.** Phase 2 of the decorator: load **map/asset mods** —
new object defs + placements + collision + `txdp` parents registered through a **gta.dat-style loader text file**,
not just vehicle dff/txd overrides. This is the "OpenSA next stage" that `lod-trees-generator` plan `008` and
`sa-procobj-placement` plan `004` defer to: it makes our own `--modloader` output (`lod/` + `hd/`) load in OpenSA,
and as a bonus loads community map mods of the same shape (MixMods "Project Props", "LOD Vegetation", "BSOR
Vegetation").

## Why this is mostly **free** in the engine (measured)

The map pipeline already reads everything **through the `fs`** — so the same `AssetFileSystem` decorator pattern
(overlay + merged text) covers it, with **no `packages/game` change**:

- **`resolveMap(fs)`** (`packages/renderware/src/map/resolve-map.ts`) reads `data/gta.dat` via `fs.getText`, then
  for each `IDE` line → `fs.getText(normalizeDatPath(path))` → `parseIde` (catalog) **+ `parseTxdParents` (txdp)**,
  and for each `IPL` line → `parseIpl` (text) **+ `loadBinaryStreams`** (bare `<base>_streamN.ipl` via `fs.get`).
- **`setTxdParents(defs.txdParents)`** is already wired in `GtaSaWorldAdapter.load` — so any `txdp` section in a
  loaded IDE takes effect (the `hd/` mod's `*_hd.ide`).
- **`buildCollisionIndex(fs)`** scans **every `.col` in `fs.names`** and keys models by name — collision is
  **auto-discovered**, so `COLFILE` lines are moot (exactly why our generators don't emit them; embedded/bare col
  just works once it's in `names` + `get`).

So the engine already turns "a richer `gta.dat` + files served by name" into catalog + placements + txdp +
collision. The whole job is in the decorator.

## What the decorator must add (on top of the vehicle overlay)

1. **Widen the override scan.** Today `scanModloader` collects `.dff`/`.txd` + `*.settings.txt`. Extend it to
   collect **all** mod asset files — `.ide`, `.ipl`, `.col`, and stock data overrides (`.dat`) — into the same
   **basename → bytes** index, and add them to `names` (so `buildCollisionIndex` sees the `.col`, `loadBinaryStreams`
   sees the streams, clump/txd loaders see the dff/txd).
2. **Detect loader files by _content_, not name.** Folder layout and the loader filename **vary** (`loader.txt`
   vs `Loader.txt`; nested under `lod/`, `hd/`, `Project Props 4/Custom Props/Props/…`). A file is a loader iff,
   after dropping `#` comments + prose lines, ≥ 1 line parses as a gta.dat directive (`IDE`/`IPL`/`COLFILE`). This
   cleanly **excludes** `readme.txt` (no directives) and the vehicle `*.settings.txt` (its lines start with a
   model/number, never `IDE`/`IPL`/`COLFILE`) — belt-and-braces, also skip `*.settings.txt` by name.
3. **Merge loader directives into `data/gta.dat`.** Collect the `IDE`/`IPL` lines from **every** loader file (a mod
   can ship several — `lod/loader.txt` + `hd/loader.txt`), append them to the base `gta.dat`, and serve that as the
   `getText('data/gta.dat')` override (same merged-text mechanism as the vehicle settings). `resolveMap` then loads
   the mod's new `lodtrees.ide` (defs), `lodtrees_hd.ide` (txdp), and `lod_procobj.ipl` (placements). **`COLFILE`
   lines are parsed** (`loader.ts`) but need no wiring — the `.col` is auto-discovered (see the `COLFILE` section).
4. **Resolve every IDE/IPL read by basename.** `resolveMap` reads IDE/IPL by their gta.dat path
   (`fs.getText('data/maps/lodtrees.ide')`, the stock `data/maps/<area>.ipl` override); `get`/`getText` must match
   the request's **basename** against the mod index (any depth, case-insensitive, spaces allowed — e.g.
   `Project Props - Trees.ipl`). This is exactly how real Modloader resolves files (bare name, on-disk path
   irrelevant) and how the modified **stock** text IPL / binary stream overrides shadow their originals (their
   basename equals the stock file's, already in stock `gta.dat`, so no loader line is needed for them).

That's the whole design: **overlay by basename + merged `gta.dat`**. No new map/parsing code in the engine.

## Mapping our generator output → this loader

| Generator output (`--modloader`)                             | How it loads in OpenSA                                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `lod/loader.txt` = `IDE data/maps/lodtrees.ide`              | merged into gta.dat → `resolveMap` loads `lodtrees.ide` (impostor defs) by basename                                                                            |
| `lod/data/maps/<area>.ipl` (modified stock text IPL)         | basename override of the stock IPL (already in gta.dat) → repointed `lod` rows                                                                                 |
| `lod/gta3img/<area>_streamN.ipl` (modified stream)           | `loadBinaryStreams` reads it by bare name → the HD `lod` repoint applies                                                                                       |
| `lod/gta3img/lodtrees.{dff,txd,col}`                         | dff/txd by name (clump/txd loaders); `.col` auto-discovered by `buildCollisionIndex`                                                                           |
| `hd/loader.txt` = `IDE data/maps/lodtrees_hd.ide`            | merged → `resolveMap` `parseTxdParents` → `setTxdParents` (stock TXD ← custom)                                                                                 |
| `hd/gta3img/<model>.dff` + custom `.txd`                     | served by bare name; the `txdp` parent makes the custom textures resolve                                                                                       |
| lod-procobj `lod/loader.txt` = `IDE … + IPL lod_procobj.ipl` | merged → new defs + the static scatter→IPL placements                                                                                                          |
| lod-procobj `lod/data/procobj.dat` (disable rows)            | **additively merged** onto stock — each converted `(surface,model)` rule replaced with `spacing=∞` ⇒ scatter disabled; stock species kept (see the strip note) |

## Caveats the design must respect (called out by the user + the examples)

- **Folder names vary / are meaningless** — `lod/`, `hd/`, `map/gta3.img/`, `files dff/`, `Project Props 4/Custom
Props/Props/…`. The scan walks the modloader subtree at **any depth**; nothing keys off a folder name.
- **Loader filename varies** — `loader.txt` / `Loader.txt` (and prose header lines like `bennet tank`, `LOD
Vegetation by …`). Content-based detection, case-insensitive, prose-tolerant.
- **Paths**: backslash or forward slash, any case, **spaces** (`DATA\MAPS\X.IDE`, `data/maps/Project Props - X.ipl`,
  `modloader\BSOR_Vegetation\thetxdp.ide`). Normalize like `normalizeDatPath` (backslash→slash, lowercase) and key
  by basename.
- **`readme.txt` and other non-loader `.txt`** must not be misread as loaders (the content check handles it).
- **Text encoding** — some mods ship a `Loader.txt`/data file as **UTF-16** (e.g. the SA Brightened Project's
  Notepad-saved `Loader.txt`), which a plain UTF-8 decode turns to garbage so its directives never register.
  Handled in `@opensa/vfs` `getText` (BOM-aware: UTF-16 LE/BE → the right decoder; a UTF-8 BOM is stripped; no BOM
  = UTF-8), which the modloader scan + the engine both read through.

## `COLFILE` + additive `.dat` merges (✅ implemented)

- **`COLFILE`** — `parseLoader` (`loader.ts`) now reads `COLFILE <level> <path>` (level dropped) alongside `IDE`/
  `IPL`, so a COLFILE-only loader is still recognised. It needs no extra wiring: the referenced `.col` ships under
  the mod tree, is bucketed into `assets` by extension, lands in `names`, and `buildCollisionIndex` **auto-discovers**
  it by model name. So `COLFILE` is honoured implicitly — the directive is parsed for completeness/future use.
- **Additive `.dat` merges** — `data-merge.ts` (`ADDITIVE_DAT` + `mergeDataFile`): `object.dat` (key = model) and
  `procobj.dat` (key = `surface+model`) are **line-merged** onto stock — a mod row **replaces** the stock row with
  the same key and new keys are appended, keeping every untouched stock row + comments. So a community mod that ships
  only its new procobj species (e.g. Project Props) keeps the base game's, and several mods stack. **procobj.dat
  replaces by key on purpose** — the engine parses it as a flat list, so an appended duplicate `(surface, model)`
  would scatter the species twice. `scan.ts` accumulates every mod copy per file (`dataMerges`); `index.ts` folds
  them onto `fs.getText('data/<file>')`.
- **`surfinfo.dat` / `plants.dat` stay whole-file overrides** (in `texts`) — `surfinfo.dat` is a **positional**
  table (index = COL material id), so appending would corrupt the indexing; line-merging them is unsafe.

> **`procobj.dat` strip interaction — resolved (disable rows).** Additive merge can't **remove** a stock species by
> omission, so `lod-procobj --modloader` no longer ships a _stripped_ `procobj.dat` (which the merge would undo,
> re-adding the species from stock → scattered _and_ statically placed = doubled). Instead it emits **disable rows**:
> each converted `(surface, model)` rule re-stated with `spacing = 1e999` (→ `Infinity` ⇒ the scatter's
> `area / spacing` is exactly 0 ⇒ deterministically zero placements). The additive merge replaces the stock rule by
> `(surface, model)`, so the species stops scattering while untouched stock species are kept. Implemented in
> `disableProcObj` (`@opensa/map-placement/procobj-strip`), wired via `convertProcObj({ disableScatter: modloader })`.

## Out of scope / open (this extension)

- **Cross-mod / mod-vs-mod conflict priority** — still out of scope (per the vehicle phase). Basename collisions are
  last/first-scan-wins, undefined.
- **gta.dat line ordering / dedup** — appended after stock lines; `resolveMap` is last-IDE-wins for the catalog, so
  new ids (ours are fresh) don't clash. Duplicate `IPL` lines are deduped on merge (`mergeGtaDat`).
- **CLEO `.cs` scripts — out of scope.** OpenSA has no CLEO runtime; a mod's `.cs` won't run (e.g. the SA
  Brightened Project's "Illuminated Vinewood Sign" — its static IPL placement loads, the scripted illumination
  doesn't). Not a modloader concern.

## Task plan (phases) — extension

1. **Widen scan. ✅** `scan.ts`: `ModloaderScan` now buckets `.dff`/`.txd`/`.col` + binary `_stream` IPLs into
   `assets` (bytes, by bare name) and `.ide`/text `.ipl`/`.dat` into `texts` (by bare name); loader files into
   `mapRefs`; `*.settings.txt` into `settings`.
2. **Loader detect + parse. ✅** `loader.ts` `parseLoader`: collects `IDE`/`IPL` (via `parseGtaDat`) + `COLFILE`
   paths; a `.txt` with none of them (readme/prose) contributes nothing, and `*.settings.txt` routes to vehicle
   settings. The `.col` is auto-discovered by `buildCollisionIndex`, so `COLFILE` needs no further wiring.
3. **Merge into `gta.dat`. ✅** `merge.ts` `mergeGtaDat`: append the collected `IDE`/`IPL` lines to the base
   `gta.dat` (dedup by normalized path); exposed via the `getText('data/gta.dat')` override in `index.ts`.
4. **Basename resolution. ✅** `index.ts` `withModloader`: `get` → `assets.get(baseName)` ?? passthrough; `getText`
   → merged-text ?? `texts.get(baseName)` ?? passthrough; `names` = `fs.names ∪ assets.keys()` (so
   `buildCollisionIndex` finds the `.col`). Ingestion + app wiring (`use-asset-boot.ts`) were already free from the
   vehicle phase — the call site is unchanged.
5. **COLFILE + additive `.dat` merges. ✅** `loader.ts` parses `COLFILE`; `data-merge.ts` (`ADDITIVE_DAT` +
   `mergeDataFile`) line-merges `object.dat`/`procobj.dat` (replace-by-key + append, keeping stock); `surfinfo.dat`/
   `plants.dat` stay whole-file overrides. `scan.ts` accumulates per-file copies (`dataMerges`); `index.ts` folds
   them onto stock. (See the procobj.dat strip-interaction note.)
6. **Verify (offline). ✅** `index.integration.test.ts`: a `lod/`+`hd/` map mod wrapped by `withModloader` → real
   `resolveMap` yields the new catalog id (`5000`), the `txdParents` (`mytreetxd → vegetation`), the text-IPL
   override instance, and the binary-stream `lod` repoint (`700` → `lod 0`). Unit tests cover scan bucketing,
   loader/COLFILE parsing (incl. `Loader.txt` + `readme.txt` negative), `mergeGtaDat`, the additive `.dat` merges,
   and the overlay reads. 37 tests pass, lint clean.
7. **In-game verify** (pending): load a game tree with the mods under `modloader/…`; confirm impostors attach at
   distance with no doubling, HD textures resolve via `txdp`, props place + collide.

## Relationship

- Consumes the output of `lod-trees-generator/008` (`lod/`+`hd/`) + `sa-procobj-placement/004` — the "OpenSA next
  stage" both defer to. Same `txdp` mechanism those use (`@opensa/map-placement/retxd` `txdpSwappedModels` →
  `parseTxdParents`/`setTxdParents` here). Reference mods: Project Props 4, LOD Vegetation, BSOR Vegetation, and the
  SA Brightened Project (the multi-mod bundle that surfaced the UTF-16 loader + `.ifp` gaps).

# Follow-up — `.ifp` (animation) override (✅ implemented)

**Status: ✅ implemented.** A `modloader/` mod can now override **animation packages** (`.ifp`) by name, like it
already overrides `.dff`/`.txd`/`.col`. Motivation: the SA Brightened Project ships zone-object animation
fixes — `cn2_ringking.ifp`, `des_stmotsigbas1.ifp` (animated map props: a rotating sign, etc.) — that previously
loaded nothing because the scan ignored `.ifp`.

## Why it's a one-line change (measured)

Both engine IFP read paths go **through the `fs` by name** — exactly the overlay pattern:

- **Zone-object clips** — `getIfp(archive, name)` (`packages/renderware/src/archive/asset-cache.ts`) does
  `archive.get('<name>.ifp')` by **bare name** (the IFP an IDE `anim` row references — this is what the SA
  Brightened Project's `cn2_ringking.ifp` etc. use).
- **Direct loads** — `GtaSaWorldAdapter.loadAnimations(ifpName)` does `requireBuffer(this.fs, ifpName)` =
  `fs.get(ifpName)` (e.g. `anim/ped.ifp`); the decorator resolves it by **basename**.

So both already read through the decorated `fs.get`. The only gap: `scanModloader` doesn't bucket `.ifp`. Adding
`.ifp` to the `assets` bucket (bytes, by bare name — the same line as `.dff`/`.txd`/`.col`/`_stream`) makes a mod's
`<name>.ifp` shadow the stock one (stock IFP live in `anim.img`; the loose override wins by name, just like
`.dff`/`.txd` shadow `gta3.img`). No engine change.

## Task plan

1. **Scan. ✅** `.ifp` added to the `assets` extension check in `scan.ts` `bucket()` (+ doc comments).
2. **Test. ✅** `scan.test.ts`: `.ifp` buckets into `assets` by bare name. `index.test.ts`: `withModloader` serves
   it by `get('x.ifp')` (getIfp's bare read) **and** `get('anim/x.ifp')` (loadAnimations' path read), and it's in
   `names`. Separately, the UTF-16 loader fix (`vfs.ts`) is covered by the real fixture
   `tests/custom/modloader/utf16-loader.txt` (the SA Brightened Project's UTF-16 `Loader.txt`).
3. **In-game verify** (pending): a mod's `<name>.ifp` animates the referenced zone object in the running game.

## Caveats

- The IFP only takes effect if something **references** it — a zone-object IDE `anim` row (mod-supplied) for
  `getIfp`, or an explicit `loadAnimations` call. The override serves the bytes; it doesn't invent the reference.
- Whether OpenSA **renders** a given zone-object animation (e.g. UV/rotation 2dfx) is a separate engine-capability
  question; this plan only covers serving the overridden `.ifp`.
