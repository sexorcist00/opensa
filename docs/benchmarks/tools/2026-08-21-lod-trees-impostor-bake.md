# Tree impostor bake: the supersampled, mip-aware atlas (lod-trees 013 step 01)

**Date:** 2026-08-21 · **Tool:** `@opensa/lod-trees-generator` (`core/raster.ts`, `core/render.ts`,
`core/dilate.ts`) + `@opensa/rw-codec` (`dxt-encode.ts`) · **Machine:** the dev Mac (darwin 25.6.0,
node 24.15.0) · **Inputs:** HD trees from `mods-src/original/vegetation`, stock trunk prelight from
`game-src/original` (the stage's `--prelight`), `--tex 512` (pmb's `treeTex`, NOT the 128 CLI default),
4 cards · **Instrument:** `scripts/debug/impostor-atlas-census.ts` (bakes in process, ~2 s per tree
against a ~10 min pmb `trees` stage).

## Why this run exists

Plan 013 measured four causes for a tree LOD looking nothing like its HD. Step 01 answers two of them —
the point-sampled bake (cause 2: 5–7 % isolated opaque texels = the white speckle) and DXT5 fitted over
black transparent texels (cause 4). The step's own acceptance is the atlas, so the atlas is what is
measured here; the field verdict comes in step 05, after 02 and 03.

## The two reference trees, before and after

`before` = the 2026-08-17 bake (point sample, binary 0.5 test, no dilation, endpoints over all 16 texels).
`after` = supersampled `--ss 2`, colour from the mip level matching one sub-sample, alpha still decided at
the base level, 6 rings of colour dilation, DXT5 endpoints fitted over visible texels only.

| | `sm_veg_tree5` before | after | `sm_veg_tree7vbig` before | after |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| canopy fill (α ≥ 128, upper 60 % of the card) | 51.1 % | 40.9 % | 56.7 % | 47.0 % |
| **canopy mass** (mean α over the same box) | **33.5 %** | **33.7 %** | **36.8 %** | **36.9 %** |
| isolated texels (binary, ≤ 1 opaque 4-neighbour) | 6.0 % | 10.9 % | 3.7 % | 5.5 % |
| **speckle** (α ≥ 128 with 4-neighbour mean < 64) | **6.0 %** | **1.1 %** | **3.6 %** | **0.4 %** |
| mean RGB over surviving texels | 42/46/34 | 43/47/35 | 65/78/58 | 63/73/55 |
| alpha-weighted RGB over the whole tile | 44/47/35 | 44/47/35 | 66/77/58 | 64/73/56 |
| median luminance over surviving texels | 42 | 42 | 64 | 67 |
| bake (4 cards, 512²) | 285 ms | 2 135 ms | 401 ms | 2 533 ms |

**Reading the table — three of those rows exist because the first ones lie once alpha is continuous:**

- **Canopy fill falls and canopy MASS does not.** The bake stopped writing every canopy texel as fully
  opaque or fully absent; an edge texel now carries its coverage. The same amount of leaf is in the
  atlas (33.5 → 33.7 %, 36.8 → 36.9 %) — it is distributed, not removed. `canopyFill` is still worth
  reading because it is what the `sa` target draws (SA alpha-tests the sorted pass at reference 100), and
  that is exactly the field question step 01 leaves open.
- **Binary "isolated" rises while speckle falls.** With antialiased edges the survivors' neighbours drop
  below 128, so every canopy core counts as isolated by the binary measure. The continuous measure —
  a surviving texel whose 4 neighbours average below half the test — is the defect as reported, and it
  goes **6.0 → 1.1 %** and **3.6 → 0.4 %**.
- **The mean RGB falls on `tree7vbig` and the median RISES (64 → 67).** That is the bright tail being
  filtered out, not the bake going dark: the alpha-weighted mean of the whole tile moves the same −2/−4/−2,
  while the median — which a tail cannot move — goes up. `tree5`, whose atlas mean was already
  representative, does not move at all (44/47/35 both sides).

## Supersampling: what each step buys

`sm_veg_tree5` / `sm_veg_tree7vbig`, everything else equal:

| `--ss` | speckle | canopy mass | bake per tree | vs before |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 1 (mip + dilation only) | 6.0 % / 3.6 % | 33.5 % / 36.8 % | 0.80 s / 0.86 s | ×2.8 |
| **2 (the default)** | **1.1 % / 0.4 %** | 33.7 % / 36.9 % | 2.13 s / 2.53 s | ×7.1 |
| 4 | 0.5 % / 0.1 % | 33.8 % / 36.9 % | 7.34 s / 9.19 s | ×25 |

The mip alone does nothing for the speckle (it is a geometric coin flip on thin leaf quads, not a texture
average); supersampling alone would keep the twig highlights. Both are needed, and the second sub-sample
step is where the defect goes.

## Stage cost — and the extrapolation that was wrong

A 9-tree sample across the roster's shapes (330 → 16 092 HD triangles, one portrait atlas), each tree loaded
with its OWN textures:

| | mean bake per tree | 9 trees |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| before | 248 ms | 2.2 s |
| after (`--ss 2`) | 1 756 ms | 15.8 s |

**×7.1** — from which this file first extrapolated "the `trees` stage goes from ~2 min to roughly 9–10 min".
**The build measured 1 940.5 s — 32.3 min, against 83.4 s on 2026-08-20 (×23).**

The gap was a defect, not the supersampling: `renderImpostor` wrapped `tree.textures` in a mip chain per
tree, and the stage hands ONE folder-wide map (148 textures) to every tree — `io.loadTree` stores it
verbatim — so every chain in the folder was rebuilt 286 times. The census never saw it because it loads only
the textures a model names. Reproduced in the stage's own shape and fixed by memoising the chain ON the
texture, plus removing the per-fragment allocations from the sampler:

| per tree, stage shape (one folder-wide texture map) | `tree5` | `tree7vbig` | `ash1_hi` | `pinetree04` |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| chain rebuilt per tree (the defect) | 11 024 ms | 11 438 ms | 10 753 ms | 12 736 ms |
| chain memoised | 2 363 ms | 2 761 ms | 2 172 ms | 3 792 ms |
| + allocation-free sampler | **1 713 ms** | **2 065 ms** | **1 698 ms** | **2 676 ms** |

The atlas is unchanged by both (the census reports the same numbers to the digit).

**The stage, measured on the rebuild:**

| `trees` stage, `sa` target, 184 impostors / 9 825 tree instances | wall-clock |
| --- | ---: |
| 2026-08-20, before this plan | 83.4 s |
| 2026-08-21, step 01 as first written (chain per tree) | 1 940.5 s (×23) |
| 2026-08-21, after the memo + the allocation-free sampler | **268.4 s (×3.2)** |

So the supersampled, mip-aware bake costs the `sa` build ~3 minutes, not the ~8 of the first extrapolation
and not the 30 of the defect. (The roster is 184 trees here, not the 286 the extrapolation assumed — another
reason that number was never going to land.)

**The lesson, again**: a per-item cost measured on a fixture that does not share what the pipeline shares is
not the pipeline's cost. The 9-tree sample was honest about the bake and blind to the stage.

## Step 02 — one winding per card

Same instrument path (`buildCardGeometry` + `encodeLodDff`, `sm_veg_tree5`, 4 cards):

| | triangles | LOD DFF |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| two windings (before) | 16 | 2 844 B |
| one winding (after) | **8** | **2 684 B** |

The bytes are not the point (−160 B × ~286 trees ≈ −45 KB); the draw is. The IDE row already carried
`DISABLE_BACKFACE_CULLING`, which both engines read, so the mirrored copy was the same face drawn twice —
and in the impostor's blend path, with no depth write, every partial-coverage texel composited twice.

The same step gives each impostor row the vegetation bits of the HD row it replaces: on the integration
game-dir, HD `0x202084` → LOD `2105476` (was `2097284`), HD `0x204084` → `2113668`, and an HD row with
double-sided + additive but no vegetation bit leaves the LOD row unchanged.

## The `sa` build that carries all of it

Full run 2026-08-21, `--exclude opensa`, resumed twice (see below): **2 026 s total**, against 676.1 s on
2026-08-20.

| stage | 2026-08-20 | 2026-08-21 |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| split | 2.2 | 1.2 |
| mods | 90.7 | 108.7 |
| vehicles | 8.3 | 9.6 |
| cutscene | 14.6 | 13.5 |
| peds | 10.8 | 13.0 |
| optimize | 90.2 | 104.9 |
| **trees** | **83.4** | **268.4** |
| **sa** | **373** | **1 503.2** |
| procobj | 2.9 | 3.5 |
| total | 676.1 | 2 026 |

**`trees` is this plan's (×3.2, above). `sa` was NOT — and the next build settled it.** The stage had been
resumed with `NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=8192` instead of the npm script's `12288`, while testing (and
disproving) an out-of-memory theory. Run again through the standard script it came back at **365.0 s**
against the 373 s baseline. So the 1 503 s was the smaller heap, not the plan, not the disk and not the
machine; nothing in steps 01–03 touches that stage, and now nothing has to be taken on that argument alone.

The run also cost three killed attempts, none of them the build's fault: a background task with no stdout is
killed after ~2–3 minutes here, and the `sa` stage prints one line at its start and nothing until it ends.
`--resume` re-entered at the last finished stage each time (it refuses over a changed commit, which is why
the first attempt had to be restarted rather than resumed). The fix was to detach the build (`nohup`) from
the task that watches it.

**What the built tree carries** (`build/original/sa`): `lodsm_veg_tree5.dff` and `lodash1_hi.dff` are
**8 triangles** each (were 16), `lodtrees.txd` is 78.7 MB of 512² DXT5, and `data/maps/lodtrees.ide` holds
**67 rows with `IS_TREE`, 10 with `IS_PALM`, 107 with neither** — the last being the finding that sent step 02
back for its OpenSA half (105 of those 107 sources are vegetation to OpenSA by NAME, not by flag).

## The `sa` build that carries step 06

Full run 2026-08-21 through the standard script, **1 285.7 s total** (676.1 s on 2026-08-20):

| stage | 2026-08-20 | steps 01–03 | steps 01–06 |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| mods | 90.7 | 108.7 | 101.6 |
| optimize | 90.2 | 104.9 | 90.4 |
| **trees** | **83.4** | **268.4** | **684.4** |
| **sa** | **373** | **1 503.2** (8 GB heap) | **365.0** |
| procobj | 2.9 | 3.5 | 3.3 |
| total | 676.1 | 2 026 | **1 285.7** |

`trees` carries the whole cost of the plan: two cages per tree plus a solve against the tree's own HD, ×8.2
over the 2026-08-20 baseline and ×2.6 over steps 01–03. Everything else is back where it was.

**What the solver chose over the whole roster** (184 trees, 3 cards, SA's reference 100): min **0.47**,
median **0.83**, max **1.00**, and **12 trees** needed no thinning at all — their three cards already cover
no more than their own canopy. That spread is the argument against a single constant: it would have missed
most of the roster in one direction or the other.

Built assets: `lodsm_veg_tree5.dff` and `lodash1_hi.dff` are **6 triangles** (16 before this plan), the atlas
is unchanged at 78.7 MB, and the `opensa-dff/` sidecar is cleaned out of the shipped tree.

## Step 03 — how dense the cage is against the tree

Instrument: `scripts/debug/impostor-density.ts` — HD mesh and card cage rendered from the SAME poses by the
same software rasteriser, 16 azimuths, at the size a tree really has on screen (a 15 m tree at SA's ~70° fov
on a 900 px viewport is ~64 px tall at the 150 u HD draw distance, ~32 px at twice it). `mass` is the mean
alpha over the canopy box — the coverage as rendered; `covered` is the share above the cutout; the bracket is
the per-azimuth spread around the mean.

**As the pair ships after steps 01–02** (cutout class, one winding, `--ss 2`, 512² atlas), 64 px:

| | covered | mass | spread | luma |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `sm_veg_tree5` HD | 27.7 % | 23.3 % | 0.92..1.06 | 27 |
| `sm_veg_tree5` LOD, 4 cards | 29.9 % (×1.08) | 22.7 % (**×0.97**) | 0.94..1.05 | 27 (×1.01) |
| `sm_veg_tree5` LOD, 2 cards | 20.6 % (×0.74) | 17.8 % (×0.77) | 0.94..1.05 | 26 (×0.98) |
| `sm_veg_tree7vbig` HD | 34.8 % | 27.0 % | 0.97..1.03 | 39 |
| `sm_veg_tree7vbig` LOD, 4 cards | 32.5 % (×0.93) | 23.3 % (**×0.86**) | 0.97..1.03 | 39 (×1.01) |
| `sm_veg_tree7vbig` LOD, 2 cards | 25.3 % (×0.73) | 20.4 % (×0.75) | 0.88..1.10 | 39 (×1.00) |

32 px moves nothing by more than 0.02 (`tree5` 4 cards ×0.97 mass, `tree7vbig` ×0.87).

**As the pair was when the field reported it** — the blend class (no depth write, cards composited), the
point-sampled atlas (`--ss 1`, whose alpha is exactly the old bake's) and two windings per card:

| | covered | mass |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| `sm_veg_tree5` LOD, 4 cards | 38.7 % (×1.38) | 37.0 % (**×1.59**) |
| `sm_veg_tree7vbig` LOD, 4 cards | 41.3 % (×1.19) | 39.6 % (**×1.47**) |

Splitting that 1.59 into its causes, `sm_veg_tree5` 4 cards, mass against the HD:

| configuration | mass |
| --- | ---: |
| blend + two windings + point-sampled alpha (before) | ×1.59 |
| blend, one winding, antialiased alpha | ×1.24 |
| cutout, one winding, antialiased alpha (after) | ×0.97 |

The canopy was ~1.5× the tree's density, and the CLASS was most of it: the same cards drawn cutout instead of
composited go from ×1.24 to ×0.97. The plan's opening estimate — four cards at ~55 % fill stacking to ~96 % —
assumed the cards' opaque texels are independent; they are four projections of the same canopy, so their
union is far below what independence predicts.

## The card rule is not the same for both targets (field-driven, 2026-08-21)

The `sa` field verdict on this build was "about the same as before". The instrument agrees, and says why:
**the class does the heavy lifting, and the `sa` target does not have it.** OpenSA welds the impostor CUTOUT
after step 02, so its four cards form a union; SA composites them in the sorted alpha pass (`DRAW_LAST`, no
depth write) whatever the flags say, so they stack.

Canopy mass against the HD, same bake, same 8 azimuths at 64 px:

| cards | SA's class (blend) `tree5` / `tree7vbig` | OpenSA's class (cutout) |
| ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 4 (today) | ×1.24 / ×1.15 | **×0.97 / ×0.86** |
| 3 | **×1.07 / ×1.04** | not measured |
| 2 | ×0.82 / ×0.82 | ×0.77 / ×0.75 |

And what the `sa` build actually moved: **×1.59 → ×1.24** on `tree5` (blend + two windings + point-sampled
alpha → blend + one winding + antialiased alpha). A quarter of the excess density is gone, the rest is the
composite itself. That is a visible-but-modest change, which is what the field reported.

**At SA's REAL reference the gap is wider still.** The rows above test at the bake's 128; SA's sorted pass
tests the impostor row at reference **100**, which keeps more texels. Re-measured there, and with the card
alpha thinned in the gamma atlas (which is already its own encode, so it costs nothing at runtime and
nothing in the build) — canopy mass vs the HD, `tree5` / `tree7vbig`:

| cards | card alpha ×1.0 | ×0.9 | ×0.85 | ×0.8 | ×0.75 | ×0.65 |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 4 | 1.36 / 1.30 | — | 1.18 / — | — / 1.06 | 0.99 / 0.96 | **0.59** / — |
| 3 | 1.19 / 1.18 | 1.07 / 1.08 | **1.00 / 1.01** | — | — | — |

and in OpenSA's cutout class, unthinned: 4 cards **0.97 / 0.87**, 3 cards 0.89 / 0.83.

Two things decide between them. **The cliff**: at reference 100 a thinned texel is DISCARDED, not faded, so
the scale has a floor — ×0.65 on four cards collapses the canopy to 0.59 of the HD's, one notch below the
×0.75 that reaches parity. Three cards need only ×0.85, which leaves a texel surviving down to alpha 118
instead of 133. **The cost**: three blended cards are 25 % fewer blended fragments per tree LOD and 6
triangles instead of 8.

So the rule step 03 picked — 4 cards — is right for the target that has the cutout class and 15–36 % too
dense for the one that does not. Three ways out, and their price is the choice: bake a SECOND card set for
`sa` at 3 cards (a second atlas, ~+4.5 min of stage), weight each card's alpha by view angle at draw time
(`asi/perfect-vegetation`, which is exactly this mechanism and was the phase-B plan), or leave `sa` at ×1.2
and take the parity only on OpenSA.

## DXT5 endpoints (`rw-codec`)

Unit measurement, one 4×4 block of eight transparent-black texels plus eight leaf greens 100–156:

| | worst green error after a DXT5 round trip |
| --- | ---: |
| endpoints fitted over all 16 texels | **26** |
| endpoints fitted over the visible 8 | **10** |

The remaining 10 is BC1's own 4-level ramp over that range, not the background. Regression-tested in
`tools/rw-codec/src/dxt-encode.test.ts` (bound 12).
