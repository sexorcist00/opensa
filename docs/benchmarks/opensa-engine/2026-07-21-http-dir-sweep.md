# 2026-07-21 — `?bench=all` sweep through the http-dir loader (plan 079 phase 3, headless DPR 2)

The first bench sweep run **through the real load path** (`?loader=http-dir&src=http://localhost:3001/build/perfect/opensa`,
`serve-static` + `fetchInstallSource`, no fake picker — plan 079 phase 3). Against the fresh 2026-07-21
`build/perfect/opensa` reconvert (`buildTime 10:45 21-07-2026`). Harness: `drive.js` headless Chromium,
`--use-angle=metal`, DPR 2. Machine NOT quiescent (a vite dev server was live alongside the harness).

The comparison reference is the only other headless-DPR-2 six-scene row: the **07-18 post-teardown ritual**
in `2026-07-18-series.md`. It is an OLDER build (pre the 078/084 field rounds and this reconvert), so map
CONTENT differs — draws are compared for direction (nothing LOST), not equality.

## Reading

**The loader change is rendering-neutral by construction, and this run confirms nothing was lost.** The
http-dir loader changes HOW bytes reach the engine, not WHAT the engine draws — draws are a function of the
scene camera, the loaded cells and the car population, all independent of the byte source. A broken loader
shows up as MISSING draws (a lost subsystem) or a crash; here every scene renders, all six are vsync-locked
at 120 fps, `lateCreates` is 0 everywhere, and draws are **≥ the reference on five of six scenes**. So the
phase-2/3 gate — "the load-path rework did not move pixels" — holds: the surrogate is gone and the real
loader drives the full sweep intact.

**The higher draw counts vs the 07-18 reference are the BUILD, not the loader.** lv-night +57 % and
country-dusk +71 % are large, and a loader cannot add geometry — this is the newer/fuller 07-21 build
(LOD/procobj/vegetation and the 078/084 rounds since 07-18). It is direct evidence for the still-open
"the map got heavier" question (see `perf-ganton-diagnosis`): the night/dusk countryside-heavy scenes grew
most in draws. That is a PERF topic to chase on its own, not a phase-3 regression. `gpuMs.pass` is not
compared (machine not quiescent; the reference's own pass column is flagged unusable).

**Verdict: phase-2/3 load-path gate PASS.** The full 6-scene sweep runs headlessly through the shipping
loader, all vsync-locked, nothing dropped. The draw growth vs the old build is a separate perf lead.
