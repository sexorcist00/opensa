# Architecture restrictions

What may depend on what, and the constants separate tools have to agree on. Violating one of these does not
produce a wrong picture — it produces a build that cannot be reasoned about.

## The runtime may never reach for the converter

`type:engine` may not depend on `type:tool` (`@nx/enforce-module-boundaries`, `eslint.config.ts:284`). The
tags allow `app → engine`, `engine → engine`, `tool → engine|tool`, and nothing else.

The consequence bites when writing TESTS, not features: a test that needs both the writer and the runtime
cannot live in `packages/game`. It goes in the tool (`tools/opensa-pack/src/vehicle-osm.test.ts` is the
worked example, and its header says why). Two tests have already been moved for this reason.

**Caught:** yes — ESLint fails the lint lane.

## The game layer touches renderware only through `adapters/` or `mods/`

`packages/game/**` may not import `@opensa/renderware` outside those two folders
(`no-restricted-imports`, `eslint.config.ts:248`). The engine must never learn what a `.dff` is.

**Caught:** yes — ESLint.

## The repo's lint is stricter than `CLAUDE.md`

Where the two disagree, ESLint wins: it requires `interface` over `type` (the opposite of the project
guideline), forbids the renderware import above, sorts module members and Set literals, and caps cognitive
complexity at 20. `commitlint` accepts `ci · chore · docs · feat · fix · perf · refactor · revert · style` —
**there is no `test` type**; a test-only change is `chore`.

**Caught:** yes — lint + the commit hook.

## One cell size, agreed by four places

The cell-LOD bake, the pack's render grid, the engine's streaming grid and the runtime config must all be
**250**. `tools/perfect-map-builder/src/config.ts` (`lodCellSize`), `tools/opensa-lod-generator/src/lod.config.ts`
(`cellSize`), opensa-pack's `CELL_SIZE`, `apps/web/src/ui/game-runtime-config.ts`.

A mismatch puts an object's HD and its LOD in **different streaming slots**, and at spawn neither loads. This
is not hypothetical: the pre-087 bake ran at 256 and gostown's bridge main span had HD in slot 5,−7 and LOD
in 5,−6.

Collision streaming and procobj scatter keep their own `GAME_CELL_SIZE` (256) — that knob is unrelated and
must not be "unified" with this one.

**Caught:** no — nothing compares the four. The symptom is missing geometry in the field.

## A field run reads the built game dir and nothing else

`build/<game>/opensa` — its `data/` included. The built `data/*` is the MERGED result with mods installed and
can differ from `game-src/<game>/data/*` completely. Diagnosing against the source tree cost a whole session
(plan 081/02: a shivering car chased against a `handling.cfg` row the game was not running).

`scripts/debug/handling-diff.ts` defaults its baseline to the BUILT table for this reason.

**Caught:** no. The check is one command: confirm which folder is being served before forming a hypothesis.

## A build asks for a target, not for the whole pipeline

`sa` and `opensa` are independent targets of the same source tree, selected with pmb's `--exclude`
(`build:game:<id>:opensa` / `build:game:original:sa`). They write disjoint subtrees of the same `--out` and
only `<out>/.work` is cleared, so an excluded target keeps whatever an earlier run left.

A plan that says "rebuild the game" has to say **which target**, because they no longer carry the same
content: the `:sa` script excludes `vehicles` and `peds`, so the real-game build ships the stock roster.

**Caught:** partly — an unknown `--exclude` name is a hard error, but a STALE target left by an older run is
indistinguishable from a fresh one.
