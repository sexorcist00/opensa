# A surface ships on a phone AND on a desk, in the same change

**The rule.** Every operator-facing capability this project adds must be usable on a phone and on a desk
**when it lands**, not in a later pass. Concretely, a change that adds a control or a capability answers all
five of these or it is not finished:

| Question | The answer that counts |
| --- | --- |
| Can a FINGER hit it? | ≥ **44 CSS px** of target where the pointer is coarse, in **BOTH axes** (`TOUCH_TARGET`, `apps/dispatch/src/ui/styles.ts`) |
| Does it fit at **360 CSS px**? | the narrowest real device in this repo's record; nothing clipped, nothing crowded off the map |
| Is it reachable WITHOUT a keyboard? | every command has an on-screen path, or the capability exists only on a desk |
| Is it reachable without HOVER? | a `title=` is a bonus, never the only label — a finger has no hover state |
| Is it ONE component with two sizes? | not two layouts to keep in step, and not a second code path |

**44 is not ours.** WCAG 2.2's enhanced target-size criterion (2.5.5) says 44×44 CSS px, Apple's HIG says
44 pt, Material says 48 dp. 44 is the number all three agree is enough, so it is the one the token carries.

**Never a bare `1fr` on a track that holds the map.** A `1fr` grid track keeps `min-width: auto`, so it
refuses to shrink below the widest row in its column — one over-wide row widens the whole grid, and the map
cell goes with it. Measured 2026-08-25 at 360 CSS px: the console's top bar came to 403 px, the single
column became 403, **and every control anchored to the map's right edge sat past the screen with nothing to
scroll to**. `minmax(0, 1fr)`, and any full-width flex row inside it takes `minWidth: 0` + `overflow:
hidden` so it gives way rather than pushing. This is the difference between a control that is small and one
that does not exist.

**Height is a third question, and width cannot answer it either.** A phone in landscape is wide and SHORT:
at 740x360 the same layout left the map 98 px, because a list under it took its share of a screen that had
none to give. `useShortViewport()` sits beside the other two.

**Width and pointer are two questions, and answering one with the other is the usual mistake.** How WIDE the
viewport is decides what fits — panels beside the map, or a tabbed sheet under it. How it is POINTED AT
decides how big a target must be. They vary independently: a phone in landscape is wide and coarse, a laptop
with a touchscreen is wide and both, a small window on a desk is narrow and fine. `useCompactLayout()` and
`useCoarsePointer()` (`apps/dispatch/src/ui/use-compact.ts`) answer them separately, and neither is a
user-agent string.

**This is the SURFACE half of the platform rule already in
[architecture.md](architecture.md).** That one governs the frame: *the PC/mobile difference is a BUDGET the
frame reads, never a branch it executes, and never a second renderer.* This one governs everything above the
frame, and it is the same principle: one component that takes a size, not two components that drift.

## Why it is a restriction rather than a note

**It is SILENT in every way a repository can be silent.** The code typechecks. It lints. Every test passes,
because a test asserts behaviour and this is geometry. And — the part that makes it expensive — **it looks
perfect on the machine of whoever wrote it**, which on a desk is a 24-pixel button that a mouse hits every
time. Nothing in this repository measures a touch target, and no benchmark row has ever contained one.

The failure reaches the operator as *"this app is fiddly on my phone"*, which is unactionable feedback
arriving weeks later, about a control nobody remembers writing.

**Violated again 2026-08-25**, and the second round is the one that says why this file is not a style note.
The three 08-22 defects were controls that were too small. These were controls **that were not on the
screen**: the layout was 403 CSS px wide inside a 360-px phone, so the right-hand column of the map's
turn/tilt/zoom cluster, the board's `Auto` switch and every call row's state were past the edge with no way
to scroll to them. The operator's report was *"impossible to control on the phone"* — which is what a
geometry failure sounds like weeks later, from the far end of the feedback loop this file was written to
shorten.

**Discovered 2026-08-22**, by being violated three times in one session while the console's operator
surface was built ([201/7-03](../plans/201-dispatch-console/7-the-operator-map/readme.md) and
[7/06](../plans/201-dispatch-console/7-the-operator-map/readme.md)):

- the map's turn, tilt and zoom controls were **24×24 px** — under half the minimum, and invisible as a
  defect on the desk they were written on;
- the search hits and saved views were ~19 px rows, same class;
- and the sharpest one: the three **zoom levels existed only on keys `1`/`2`/`3`**, so on a phone — the
  device this whole console is aimed at — that capability did not exist at all. A capability that lives only
  on a keyboard is a capability that ships to one platform.

All three are fixed in the change that wrote this file. What that fix looks like is the pattern to copy: one
component, a `touch` flag from `useCoarsePointer()`, and a second size token beside the first.

## Caught, or silent?

**PARTLY CAUGHT since 2026-08-25, and silent everywhere the guard does not reach.**

What is caught, by `apps/dispatch/src/ui/styles.test.ts`: a **bare `1fr`** in either grid template, a
`…Touch` token under 44 in either axis, and a full-width bar that can push its column. That test exists
because this file used to end by saying a lint over these literals could be written *"when this bites a
second time"* — it bit a second time, and the sizes are literals in `styles.ts`, so the guard is the test.

What is still SILENT, and it is most of the rule: a control sized inline at the call site rather than from a
token, a cluster that fits but covers the map, a capability that exists only on a keyboard, and anything
about reach or feel. The honest checks remain:

- **a render at 360 CSS px**, which the agent container CAN do even though the phone cannot — a headless
  Chromium at `(pointer: coarse)`, probing every element for a box past the viewport and every control for
  a box under 44. This found all nine of 2026-08-25's defects in one pass and is the cheapest check in this
  list; run it before handing a surface to the phone, never instead of it;
- a **real phone**, which the development machine already is
  ([development/termux.md](../development/termux.md)) — the only judge of reach, feel and safe-area insets,
  and the reason [201/3](../plans/201-dispatch-console/3-the-operator-surface-on-a-phone/readme.md) exists;
- and a reviewer reading a diff for the five questions above, which is what this file is for.
