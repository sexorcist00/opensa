# Vehicles

`packages/renderware/src/vehicle/` (`build-vehicle-model.ts` + `textures.ts` — renderer-agnostic model
build, run off the main thread by `packages/game/src/adapters/vehicle-model.worker.ts`),
`packages/game/src/vehicle/` (systems), `packages/engine/src/render/probe.ts` (the reflection probe),
host wiring in `apps/web/src/ui/engine-vehicles.ts`, plans 015–021/025/030/033 + 074/16.

Names that carry behaviour — the mod folder's files, the DFF frames, the lamp/plate materials, the data rows
— are collected in [contracts/vehicles.md](../contracts/vehicles.md).

## Implemented

- **Loading**: vehicles.ide defs, DFF with frame hierarchy KEPT (doors/wheels as named parts),
  embedded COL, generic `vehicle.txd` merge, per-model TXD. Both SA wheel conventions are built:
  a single shared `wheel` atomic instanced at the `wheel_*_dummy` frames (scaled per front/rear,
  mirrored on the right), or per-corner `wheel_{l|r}{f|m|b}` atomics placed at their own frames
  (different front/rear wheels). Both handle the middle axle (`m`) of 3-axle trucks, and per-corner
  wheels take precedence over a stray shared `wheel` atomic some exporters leave in. A lone corner
  atomic with no shared `wheel` but real `wheel_*_dummy` frames (a mis-named shared wheel some mods
  ship, e.g. comet with only `wheel_rf`) is treated as the shared wheel and instanced at all dummies,
  so it renders four wheels instead of one. A third, wheel-mod convention is also handled: an
  `f_wheel_<mask>` container frame (e.g. `f_wheel_1111`, cheetah) whose child atomics are the wheel
  sub-model — its geometry is instanced at every dummy instead of rendered once as body. **The wheel is
  the container's CHOSEN PATH** (2026-08-17, the alfamodding cabbie/stretch drove on bare tyres): a
  VehFuncs `<name>:K` walk — `f_extras:2 → tire:1 → tire` + `rim:1 → hubcap` — the whole set instanced
  as one part per dummy, fitted and tyre-classified as one solid; the first atomic alone was the tyre.
  Field-accepted 2026-08-17 (cabbie + stretch, rebaked in place). Contract row:
  [`contracts/vehicles.md`](../contracts/vehicles.md).
- **VehFuncs recursive extras are a SPAWN decision** (2026-08-17): the builder ships a car's `f_extras` /
  `f_class` tree in the `.osm` (`variants`) and tags every option's meshes; `EngineVehicleHandle` walks it once
  per car (`pickVariants` — `:N`, `:0`, `:0+`, `:N+`, class tags gating `[tag]` options), the way the plugin
  does on the SA target. Before this every variant drew at once — the cabbie wore all four taxi companies'
  roof ads and its whole trunk-clutter catalogue. 59 of 213 original mod cars carry the convention;
  fleet rebaked in place, field-accepted 2026-08-17.
  Conditions (`?c1`, `?rain`) and class characteristics (`_pj=`) are carried but not evaluated yet —
  [`hacks/vehfuncs-conditions-always-true.md`](../hacks/vehfuncs-conditions-always-true.md).
- **The clump ROOT frame's authored matrix never contributes** (2026-08-04): SA replaces it with the
  entity's world matrix on attach, and anti-rip exporters poison exactly that slot (the comet lock shipped
  `rotation[0][0] = −3.9e14` there — composing it flung every off-centre part to ±10¹⁴ while the game
  rendered the car whole). `frameWorldTransform` stops below the root; stock roots are identity, so
  well-formed models are unchanged. Rule: [`restrictions/assets-and-data.md`](../restrictions/assets-and-data.md).
- **The texture dictionary ships as SIZE BUCKETS** (2026-08-04): one `.ostex` array per native (w, h),
  BC1/BC3 chosen per bucket, each submesh naming its array — nothing is upscaled to the largest sheet.
  The single max-size array taxed every layer with the largest texture's footprint (a 32-texture mod
  dictionary hit exactly 128 MB and overran the VER2 `.img` entry ceiling; comet.osm 136.6 → 20.3 MB).
  Falls back to the legacy single array, with a logged warning, only when a submesh straddles size buckets
  or a lamps-on twin splits from its base. The pulled lever with the full accounting:
  [`performance/applied/vehicle-texture-array-buckets.md`](../performance/applied/vehicle-texture-array-buckets.md).
- **Damage components sit on their `*_dummy` frame, not on their own.** A `<part>_ok` / `<part>_dam`
  atomic is placed at the nearest matching `<part>_dummy` ancestor and the transform of its own frame is
  DISCARDED — the original's rule: `CVehicleModelInfo::PreprocessHierarchy` runs `CollapseFramesCB` over
  every damageable component, which reparents the child atomics onto the component frame and then destroys
  the child frame. Stock SA hides the difference (of 756 `_ok`/`_dam` frames across 160 stock models, only
  62 carry a non-identity transform and the largest is 6 mm), but a mod can put anything there. Because the
  frame the swing uses is the DUMMY, **scissor / lambo doors work with no special case**: a mod that turns
  a hinge frame ABOVE the dummy so its local Z lies along the car's X gets a vertical opening for free
  (the 1995 Diablo does exactly this — and parks 1.518 m on the `_ok` frame, which used to throw its doors
  clear of the car, field 2026-07-28).
- **A door is its whole hinge SUBTREE** (2026-08-04): a mod that authors the door glass or trim as separate
  atomics under `door_*_dummy` (the comet ships `glass_lf_ok` beside `door_lf_ok`) gets them SWUNG with the
  door — the builder records every part under the hinge frame as the door's roster (`VehicleDoor.parts`)
  and the handle rotates each member about the hinge, exactly as SA's frame rotation would. Stock cars
  author one atomic per door and carry no roster. Contract note (what happens when the glass is parented
  elsewhere): [`contracts/vehicles.md`](../contracts/vehicles.md).
- **Boarding reads the model's doors** (2026-08-05): entry and the exit chain pick among the FRONT door
  parts the model actually carries — a coach authored with only `door_rf` (a real bus's one front door)
  is boarded from either side through it, the approach routed around the bumper, then the seat shuffle;
  the enter RANGE measures to the vehicle's oriented footprint, not its centre (an 11 m body used to
  spend the whole range on itself). The bundled "Car Left Door" CLEO script that does this with ped
  tasks under SA stays class-C-inert — the model already says everything the ini file said.
- **Retractable ("pop-up") headlights**, read off the model — there is no per-car list anywhere. A pop-up pod
  is a `misc_*` component (SA's generic moving-component slot) holding HEAD-LAMP faces, and it is authored
  PARKED: those faces look forward and DOWN into the nose. That pitch IS the feature, so the open angle is
  `atan2(-n.z, n.y)` of the pod's mean lamp normal — measured: stock **ZR-350 = 40.4°**, the 1986 Starion mod
  (`previon`) **= 52.6°**. Swept over the whole stock archive, 49 models carry a `misc_*` component and
  exactly ONE is detected (the zr350) — the dozer blade, forklift mast, tow crane and lowrider hydraulics hold
  no lamp face, and a lamp that already looks where it lights is a light BAR, which the 5°…100° band rejects.
  The pod rides the same signal that lights the lamps and travels over 0.7 s (`VehicleRig`, fixed step), and
  the LAMPS wait for it: a pod car's beam, glow and coronas only come on once the pods stand fully open, and
  die the moment they start folding back (field 2026-07-28 — a lamp still parked in the nose lit the bodywork).
  Cars without a pod are not gated at all. A mod whose pod uses its own texture instead of `vehiclelights`
  (so it carries no marker) can DECLARE itself: a
  `features.txt` in the mod folder holding `UP/DOWN_LIGHTS` — the Modloader/IVF convention. `vehicle-installer`
  copies each mod's declaration into `data/vehicle-features.txt`, and opensa-pack reads it while baking that
  car. That path is BUILD-time only, and there is no runtime path that could pick a declaration up later —
  which is why an unconverted car is refused at spawn rather than parsed from its DFF. **On the `sa` target the
  same declaration takes a different road**: SA hardcodes the ability to a model id, so the installer writes
  `<slot> zr350` into fastman92's `data/model_special_features.dat` and the real game gives the slot the
  ZR-350's pods (plan 011; the full token → carrier table is `docs/contracts/vehicles.md` §1).
- **Paint**: carcols.dat palettes (`car` = 2-colour, `car4` = 4-colour sections); SA editable-material
  markers — primary (60,255,0), secondary (255,0,175), tertiary (0,255,255 cyan), quaternary
  (255,255,0 yellow). NB (255,175,0)/(255,60,0) are per-lamp ids on the `vehiclelights` atlas, **not**
  paint markers. Colour spec strings `"p,s[,t,q]"` with omitted 3rd/4th defaulting to palette 0 (SA
  behaviour); RW modulate (texture × material colour) for non-marker textured materials (dark interiors fix).
- **Reflections** (plan 030 → 074/16 → 084): MatFX env coefficient + SA reflection/specular plugin data
  carried per material. A material is reflective when its env map has a coefficient (a coefficient of 0 is
  SA's own "not reflective" marker on tyres and rubber, and it wins over everything else), or — with no env
  map at all — when it is UNTEXTURED and carries the `reflection` plugin, which is how SA authors bare metal
  such as exhausts and trim. The env TEXTURE is not the colour source and is not uploaded at all: the shader reflects the live probe, so
  neither a varying nor an array layer is spent on it (two layers per car; the mod comet's 1024² array went
  96 → 84 MB RGBA). The engine runs a skygfx-style "neo" car pipe — the base colour LERPs toward a live scene
  **cube probe** (`packages/engine/src/render/probe.ts`, 128²×6, refreshed a couple of faces per frame) —
  with a per-material class (matte/paint/chrome/glass) chosen from the material data, never from names.
  The three-era presets (`packages/game/src/plugins/vehicle-reflection/presets.ts`) survive only as
  debugger tuning values.
- **Self-occlusion** (plan 084, 2026-07-22): `sky-occlusion.ts` gives every vertex a sky-visibility value
  from a height field over the car's own shown shell — horizon mapping, 8 azimuths, weighted by the vertex
  normal so a roof darkens the cabin under it and not the door skin beside it. It is computed in the shared
  BUILDER, so every caller of `buildVehicleModel` agrees by construction, and rides in the night set's alpha
  (no extra buffer). The `_vlo` LOD and `_dam` twins receive it but never cast, which is what keeps a
  convertible's cabin open. The engine's dynamic indirect term is `params.y × DYNAMIC_INDIRECT ×
  skyVisibility(normal) × occlusion` — the map's `prelit × params.y × ao`, with a constant standing in for
  the prelit a car has no data for. `skyVisibility` / `DYNAMIC_INDIRECT` live in the shared `<frame>` shader
  module (next to `localLightStatic`) so the ped path reuses the exact same weight, minus the per-instance
  occlusion a ped has no bake for (plan 087 ped — see character.md).
- **Tyre detection** (plan 084, 2026-07-22): `wheel-tyre.ts` finds the RUBBER of a wheel by geometry, never
  by texture name (the field set says `tire`, `tyre`, `tread`, `wheel`, `vehicletyres128`, `generic_tire_01`
  — it disagrees with itself). A wheel is a disc about its axle and the tyre is its outer band: measured
  across the game, tyre materials sit at a mean radius of 0.87–0.98 of the wheel's own maximum and every rim
  material at 0.18–0.70. A detected tyre is forced MATTE — no reflection, no specular, because rubber does
  not shine — while the rim beside it keeps whatever the DFF authored. 180 of 215 stock vehicles have a
  separable tyre; the other 35 (boats, aircraft, RC, and a few cars with one material over the whole wheel)
  simply have none, which is a supported answer. The submesh keeps a `tyre` flag for the damageable-tyre
  work that will want it.
- **Glass** (plan 025): window materials detected and rendered transparent (double-sided,
  sorted).
- **Translucency is judged per SUBMESH over its own UV region, not per texture** (2026-08-04,
  `hasAlphaIn`): mod interiors share alpha atlases (the comet's shelf and gauge housings sit on
  `911_lights`), and the whole-texture answer sent opaque parts into the no-depth blend phase — the world
  showed through the shelf. A region that genuinely samples transparent texels (glass, decals, needles)
  still blends. The translucent SORT keys on the eye's exact distance to the submesh's part-local AABB
  (clamp-into-box; `VehicleModelSubmesh.bounds`) — the earlier `centroid − radius` sphere over-reached on
  scattered submeshes and drew the dash crisp OVER the window sheet. Forensics:
  [`open-issues/fixed/vehicle-glass-see-through.md`](../open-issues/fixed/vehicle-glass-see-through.md).
- **Extras** (`extraN` components): SA's mutually-exclusive optional parts modelled at the same spot (e.g. the
  Benson's swappable advertising boards, the mod admiral's exhaust-and-mudflap set). All alternatives ship in
  the model, each submesh tagged with its `extraN` frame; **the pick is per SPAWN**, made by
  `EngineVehicleHandle` and applied through the same per-instance submesh visibility that hides `_dam` and
  `_vlo`. So two cars of one model wear different optional parts, which is what SA does. It used to be a
  build-time `Math.random()` in the builder, which froze one alternative into the pak for every car in the
  world and re-rolled it on each convert (2026-07-22). Without a pick, all `extraN` atomics render on top of
  each other (overlapping jumble) — the viewer therefore shows the first and the lab's convoy walks them.
- **Physics** (plans 017/018): Rapier dynamic chassis from the COL convex hull, raycast wheels
  (suspension), handling.cfg parsed (kept for tuning), enter/exit flow with seat alignment
  (plan 016) — the run-to-door is interruptible (movement input or a blocked path hands control back,
  GTA-style), damage system (plan 019) using the full COL. The scripted clips
  (`car_getin_lhs`/`_rhs`, `car_getout_lhs`/`_rhs`, `car_sit`, `car_shuffle_rhs`, `car_crawloutrhs`)
  are requested BY NAME (shared const
  `VEHICLE_SCRIPTED_CLIPS` in `packages/game/src/vehicle/vehicle-clips.ts`) and resolved by the player from
  `ped.ifp` — a scripted clip registers only when it resolves (`duration > 0`), else the driver falls back to
  the standing locomotion pose (see character.md). While seated the ped rides the car's FULL orientation
  (tilts/flips with it), positioned at the `ped_frontseat` dummy.
- **Ingress/egress realism** (plan 088/09, 2026-07-24): the climb-in/out slides replay each clip's
  authored ROOT MOTION (extracted from the IFP by `rootMotion`, warped between the real doorway and
  seat by `warpAlongRootMotion` — a TC without the clip degrades to the old linear slide, and the
  slide runs the CLIP's duration, not a constant). Entry picks the NEAR front door: the passenger
  side opens `rf` (mirrored swing), climbs into the passenger seat and shuffles across on
  `car_shuffle_rhs`; the step-in walks a three-leg route around the OPEN panel (back along the
  1.2 m standoff ring past the swept edge, inboard behind it, forward into the doorway). Exit runs
  an egress chain — driver door → passenger door → windscreen crawl (`car_crawloutrhs` to a
  ground-anchored spot past the bonnet) → appear on the roof — each spot gated by two HORIZONTAL
  `PhysicsWorld.pathClear` rays at 0.35/0.85 m above the REAL ground under the car (a centre-height
  anchor grazed cambered roads and false-blocked the driver side), reaching 0.6 m past the doorway;
  the car, all sensors AND the rider's own collider are excluded. A WRECK (`!isUpright` — roof-down
  or on a flank) probes four planar exits (right → left → nose → tail) and crawls out the first
  clear one; the door that swings is mapped to the crawl-out's WORLD flank through the body's full
  orientation (`doorOnWorldFlank` — roof-down mirrors model x in world, so the yaw-frame name is
  the wrong panel), with appear-on-top when boxed in.
  Door choreography: per-side angle tracking; the exit door stays open while the player stands in
  the doorway and shuts once he steps clear (the same footprint trigger that restores collision).
- **Drivetrain** (plan 081/04, `vehicle/drivetrain.ts`): the original's own transmission, translated —
  `cTransmission::InitGearRatios` + `CalculateDriveAcceleration`. Gears split the speed range into bands with
  hysteresis, thrust falls with the gear (first pulls 4× top), `engineInertia` costs a beat of push on every
  shift, and `drive` (F/R/4) divides the engine by 2 or 4. **Air drag is what limits top speed** — `dragMult ×
  v² / 2000` against the whole velocity vector, so `fMaxVelocity` acts as the upper bound of the search for
  the point where drag balances the engine, not as a cap someone clamps to. Before this the whole longitudinal
  model was one constant force and a hard speed limit: every car pulled as hard at 140 km/h as at walking
  pace. Only the DRIVEN car gets drag today — nothing else in the world drives itself. The chassis linear
  damping (0.1) is a guessed constant the original does not have — it adds `0.1 × v` of phantom drag (~3× a
  sports car's authored figure at speed) — kept on a field verdict for now; retiring it is owed as its own
  single-variable step with a coast-down capture.
- **Standing pose + visible travel** (2026-07-27 audit; plan 081/06 §3's travel half): a car RESTS near full
  droop, by the original's own `SetupSuspensionLines` law — the wheel hangs `|suspLower| −
  weightShare/(forceLevel × axleBias) × span` below its dummy, so the body rides correspondingly high (the
  wheel-at-hub rule before it sat every car low in proportion to |lower|; the turismo's −0.20 made it the
  loudest). The DRAWN wheel follows the physics spring length through `VehicleRig` → `setWheel({ lift, spin,
  steer })` → `RigidEntity.setPartTranslation`, smoothed at the fixed step so raycast jitter does not read as
  a vibrating wheel.
- **Wheels lean the way the car was authored** (plan 081/06 §3): `handling.cfg`'s `modelFlags` names each
  axle — `NOTILT · SOLID · MCPHERSON · REVERSE`, the 5th hex digit for the front and the 6th for the rear —
  and the drawn wheels follow it. A **SOLID** axle is one beam, so both its wheels take `atan(Δlift / track)`
  and stay upright while the body leans over them (a pickup's rear end in a corner); an **independent** or
  McPherson axle leans a fraction of that with the compressed wheel taking its top inward; **NOTILT** stays
  square. The engine handle composes `steer(Z) ⊗ camber(Y) ⊗ spin(X)`, in that order, so a steered wheel
  cambers about ITS OWN forward axis and a rolling one does not drag its lean round with it. 27 rows of the
  built `handling.cfg` author an axle, 19 of them a solid rear one (savanna, tornado, picador, sadler,
  blade, towtruck, tractor…).
- **Wheels in the air** (plan 081/06, field report): a DRIVEN wheel with nothing under it spins with the
  ENGINE, not with the car — the original's own rule (`CAutomobile::ProcessCarWheelPair`: 250 rad/s² forward,
  125 backward, and its `±1.0` test is a refusal to fight a wheel already spinning the other way rather than
  a speed cap). Every other airborne wheel runs down at 0.95 per 1/50 s. On the ground the wheel turns with
  the car's real displacement, as before, so a parked car keeps its wheels still.
- **Air control** (plan 081/06 §1): with every wheel off the ground for 0.15 s, W/S pitch the car, A/D roll
  it and A/D with the handbrake yaws it — the original's own block (`CAutomobile::ProcessControl`), which
  works out as `1.75 rad/s²` per unit of stick for any car up to 3000 `fTurnMass` and proportionally less
  above it, with the original's 1 rad/s "do not fight a tumble" gate. The debounce is ours: four suspension
  rays blink off over a kerb where SA's contact-wheel count does not. `?airCtl=<×>` scales it (0 = off) and
  every `[phys]` capture records the value, because gravity here is 9.81 against SA's 20 — the same jump lasts
  about twice as long, so the same law buys about twice the rotation.
- **Driving controls** (plan 081/04): Space and back-while-rolling are the FOOT brake — it ramps in over 0.2 s
  and splits across the axles by `fBrakeBias`; **H is the handbrake**, and it is a REAR-AXLE LOCK, not a
  bigger brake (`CAutomobile::ProcessCarWheelPair` gives the rear wheels 20 000 and leaves the front alone).
  A locked wheel brakes with everything its tyre has and keeps only 3 % of its lateral stiffness, so the back
  steps out and the car rotates about a front axle that still grips — the SA handbrake turn. Off the throttle
  a car coasts on the original's own wheel friction (`fWheelFriction / mass`, a mass-independent retarding
  force), not on a share of its own brakes.
- **Steering** (plan 081/05): the full authored `fSteeringLock` is available, limited only by what the tyres
  can answer — the original's own limiter, `asin(min(adhesive × traction × 16 / v², 1)) / lock`, where
  `adhesive` is the rubber-on-road cell of `data/surface.dat` (4.5). It does not touch town driving (full lock
  to ~53 km/h) and tightens with the square of speed. Countersteering into a slide and the handbrake both
  restore full lock, as they do in the original.
- **Tyres** (plan 081/05 baseline + the 081/09 speed assist): grip per wheel is `fTractionMultiplier` read
  as a friction coefficient, split across the axles by `fTractionBias` — the field-liked baseline after
  every SA-derived scale (and the whole 2 g world, 081/08) was field-rejected; the postmortem
  (`docs/postmortem/081-vehicle-physics/sa-faithful-feel.md`) carries that story. On top of it, **the
  grip is scaled by WHAT THE WHEEL STANDS ON** (081/10): `surface.dat`'s rubber row through the surface under
  each wheel — tarmac 4.5 (unchanged), grass and gravel 3.2, sand 3.0, wet 2.8, rock 3.6 — read per wheel
  from the collision material, with the steering limiter given the SAME number so it never grants lock the
  tyre cannot answer. Note SA's own classification: `dirt` and `dirttrack` are group ROAD, so a dirt road
  grips like tarmac; what actually changes is grass, sand and rock. `?surfGrip=0` puts every wheel back on
  tarmac, and every capture records which world it drove in. On top of that, **the
  LATERAL grip grows with speed** (081/09): `frictionSlip × min(1 + (v/12 m/s)², 3)` — a deliberate,
  documented assist with the inverse shape of the "helpless at 130 km/h" complaint. Virtual only: the
  engine clamp and the brake cap stay on the unboosted grip, so launches, acceleration, braking, weight and
  town-speed feel are the baseline's, byte for byte. Dials are session-tunable (`?gripVd`, `?gripCap`) and
  every capture records the active values. The longitudinal clamp is applied on OUR side in
  `setVehicleControls`, because Rapier applies its own friction limit only when a wheel already has a side
  impulse — a car accelerating or braking dead ahead is otherwise unlimited. Engine force reaches driven
  wheels only (`nDriveType`). A wheel that has **broken loose grips less** (`fTractionLoss`, 0.72…0.85): past
  the limit a tyre does not merely stop giving more, it gives less, which is what makes a slide continue
  instead of self-correcting. Sliding is detected from the wheel's own impulses against its friction circle,
  because Rapier does not expose its `skid_info`.
- **Physics telemetry** (plan 081/01): `vehicle/vehicle-telemetry.ts` derives one frame per fixed step for
  the DRIVEN car — signed speed, lateral speed, body slip angle, per-wheel longitudinal slip ratio, pitch
  (**positive nose UP**, the sign the braking complaint is measured by), roll (positive right-side down),
  yaw rate, body-frame g (net Δv/dt, gravity excluded), and per wheel: contact, suspension compression as a
  fraction of travel, normal load, and the tyre impulses Rapier actually delivered. The math is pure — raw
  readings come in as plain data from `PhysicsWorld.readVehicleWheels` + the body, so the same sample
  sequence replays identically in a test. `EnterVehicleSystem.appliedControls()` supplies what `drive()`
  really applied (ramped engine force, slewed steer), not the raw input. **Off by default and inert then**
  (`vehicles.telemetry.enabled`); only the seated car is sampled, and its history resets when the player
  changes cars. This is the slip/speed channel plan 080/05 will read for drift framing.
- **LOD/streaming** (plan 021): HD/LOD/unload distances per vehicle (80 / 250 / 500), placements respawn. Two
  rules the distances hide, both learned in the field on 2026-08-02
  ([the fix](../open-issues/fixed/parked-cars-do-not-respawn.md)): a car is only **created** within
  `min(lodDistance, streaming.collisionDrawDistance)` — 150, not 250 — because a body spawned past the
  collision radius has no ground and free-falls; and an unloaded entry's respawn trigger is anchored to its
  **placement**, not to wherever the car ended up, or a shunted car takes its spot's trigger away with it. A
  spawn is allowed to be REJECTED (that is how it waits for its collision cell); an entry that keeps failing
  is reported once per model.
- **Headlights** (plan 033, ⚠️ MVP — redo later; the lamp EXISTENCE rule is 098/11 — a lamp is where the
  model's dummy is, with no fallback, and the lamp material only decides whether the lens glows):
  glowing lamp glass + coronas at the lamp dummies; lamps
  found by position near the `headlights`/`taillights` dummies; no road beam yet. See night-and-time.md.
- Spawn tooling: debug Vehicles screen lists **every** car from `vehicles.ide` (sorted, with a name filter);
  the list comes from `vehicleModelsFromIde` (apps/web) — no hardcoded car set.
- **Two populations of parked cars**, both registered lazily and streamed by the LOD system; the boot log
  prints the size of each (`[vehicles] parked placements registered: N`, `map car generators registered: N`
  — a census line is the only thing that distinguishes an empty map from a full one):
  - **`parked.json`** in the VFS (a `VehiclePlacement[]` shipped per game; read by `parseParkedVehicles` in
    apps/web). Absent → none. Stock `original` ships 212 placements over 24 models. (Replaced the old
    hardcoded `GAME_CONFIG.vehiclesSpawn`.)
  - **Map car generators** — the binary IPL `CARS` section (plan 059): 1043 in stock SA, 301 specific over 83
    model ids plus 742 random resolved through `popcycle`/`cargrp` by city and hour. Registered by
    `engine-canvas-host` after the city boxes exist, since the random draw asks which city a spot is in.
- Mods: a vehicle's model/texture/data is installed by `vehicle-installer` at BUILD time (`--rebake <game>
  [--only <model>]` re-does one car in ~3.6 s against an already-built game; `--kind sa` does the same to the
  real-SA tree in ~4 s). There is no runtime overlay —
  see [postmortem/runtime-modloader-overlay.md](../postmortem/runtime-modloader-overlay.md). Assets resolve by
  their **bare** name, so there is no loose `vehicles/` folder. See [mods.md](mods.md).
  On the **`sa` target only**, a mod folder can also speak to the plugins that install carries: a
  `model-variations-extra.txt` section reaches ModelVariations 10.7 (which trailers the slot tows, how often)
  and a `text.txt` becomes `cleo/<model>.fxt`, the shop names of its own tuning parts (plan 012). Our engine
  has neither plugin — the trailer/tuning-shop equivalents are the two leftovers below.

## Known gaps / candidates

- Headlights proper redo (road beam projected onto the asphalt; per-lamp brake/indicator/reverse) — MVP has none.
- No NPC traffic (headlight gating already generalizes via `seated`).
- Damage is collision-driven deformation state, not visual mesh swaps for every panel.
- No vehicle audio.
- **LEFTOVER — extras = "exactly one"**: the current `extraN` handling shows exactly one of the mutually-exclusive
  components, which covers the Benson (ad boards) and similar variant sets. SA's real rule is more nuanced — **two
  independent slots** chosen by the `carcols` component rules, each able to resolve to "nothing". If a vehicle ever
  needs **two simultaneous** extras (or a chance of **none**), that's a follow-up built on top of the same
  `hiddenExtraFrames` helper (it would need the carcols comp rules, which we don't parse yet).
- **LEFTOVER (engine) — carmods / vehicle upgrades**: `carmods.dat` is now **parsed** (`parseCarmods` in
  `@opensa/renderware`, added for the `vehicle-installer` tool's settings merge), but it is **not wired into the
  engine** yet — the in-game vehicle **component/upgrade** system (mod-shop parts, the `link`/`wheel` rules) is a
  future iteration. No adapter/runtime usage.
- **LEFTOVER (engine) — cargrp / population vehicles**: `cargrp.dat` (the per-ped-type vehicle distribution) is now
  **parsed** (`parseCarGroups` in `@opensa/renderware`, added for `vehicle-installer`'s `--strip`), but it is **not
  wired into the engine** — the in-game **population/traffic** car selection is a future iteration. No runtime usage.

## Test coverage anchors

`vehicle/build-vehicle-model.test.ts` (markers, modulate, parts, extras — synthetic + real
petro-6wheels.dff), `vehicle/textures.test.ts`, `adapters/vehicle-model-builder.test.ts`,
vehicle systems tests (physics/lod/damage), adapter vehicle data tests,
`vehicle/vehicle-telemetry.test.ts` (channel signs and conventions, the rate channels reading 0 on the
first step, slip floors, the ring's order and capacity) and `physics/physics-world.test.ts`
(`readVehicleWheels` against real Rapier: airborne = no contact, resting = compressed springs whose loads
sum to the car's weight).
