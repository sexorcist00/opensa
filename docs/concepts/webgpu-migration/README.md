# Concept: WebGPU migration

**Question:** can moving the OpenSA renderer from WebGL2 to WebGPU break the CPU draw-call wall and turn OpenSA
into a genuinely AAA-capable browser engine?

**Status: 🎓 GRADUATED to [docs/plans/073-webgpu-migration](../../plans/073-webgpu-migration-threejs/readme.md)
(2026-07-11).** The park below lasted hours: the focused bundle hunt (patched three, see
[phase-1-findings.md](phase-1-findings.md)) made static render bundles WORK in the real engine — fast load, live
camera, smooth driving, **~13 ms render CPU vs the 65 ms WebGL baseline**. These concept docs remain as the
research record; actionable work lives in the plan chain.

**Status: 🅿️ PARKED (2026-07-11) — three's WebGPU renderer is not ready for this streaming workload.**
The synthetic spikes said GO (render bundles cut submission ~6×, per-cell invalidation granular), but the
**real-engine integration failed in the field**: bundles never rendered correctly in-engine (static-bundle
transform baking), and per-InstancedMesh pipeline compilation (three's own TODO, PR 29066) freezes streaming with
no working pre-warm — in practice the WebGPU path ended up **worse than WebGL**. Full chronology + resume
conditions in **[phase-1-findings.md](phase-1-findings.md)** (the FINAL VERDICT section).

What the effort yielded on the shipping WebGL path: the **three 0.177 → 0.185.1 upgrade**, the r185
invisible-dynamics shadow fix, PCF shadows, and a complete map of the upstream blockers. **Correction (2026-07-11): PR 29066 itself MERGED in Aug 2024 — the uuid-in-key IS the merged workaround.** What's
pending upstream is the structural `referenceBuffer()` refactor its discussion calls for, with no timeline; the same
thread has a maintainer benchmark of WebGPURenderer ~3× slower than WebGL on complex scenes — matching our field
result. Resume only when that architecture work lands (re-run the spikes first). Meanwhile the "leave three?"
question is being measured: see the **Babylon spike** (`/babylon-spike.html`, snapshot rendering = mature
record-once + a streaming reset-cost scenario).

<details><summary>Pre-park status (the spike results that justified trying)</summary>

- **Phase 0:** render bundles cut per-frame draw submission ~6× (WebGPU+bundle 4.3 ms vs WebGL 10.3 ms vs WebGPU
  no-bundle 27 ms @ 15k draws) and move heavy per-draw material cost to record-time. WebGPU _without_ bundles
  regresses — bundles are the whole win.
- **Phase 1a:** per-cell `BundleGroup` invalidation is **granular** — a cell swap re-records one cell (steady
  4.5 ms → swap 8.9 ms), not the world.

## TL;DR — honest verdict up front

|                                         |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Does it target the real bottleneck?** | **Yes.** The wall is CPU draw-call submission (65 ms/frame, 92 %). WebGPU render bundles + lower driver overhead attack it directly, without touching the art. Nothing else we tried does.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **Expected upside**                     | Realistically **2–4×** frame-rate on the CPU-bound scenes (≈13 fps → ≈30–50 fps), by collapsing the ~65 ms submission cost to single-digit ms. Then we become GPU-bound (~32 fps floor today) — which further work (fewer triangles, cheaper post-FX) can lift.                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Cost**                                | **Large.** A near-total rewrite of the rendering layer: renderer swap, **all custom shaders → TSL** (~2 300 lines of GLSL across 7 files, 5 `onBeforeCompile` patch sites), and the **entire post-FX stack** (currently the WebGL-only `postprocessing` lib) rebuilt on three's WebGPU node post-processing. Estimate: **many weeks, plausibly 2–3 months** of focused work.                                           |
| **Biggest risks**                       | (1) three.js WebGPU **render-bundle** maturity / whether it auto-applies to a streaming scene; (2) TSL re-implementation of the complex `world-material` (sun/CSM/night/fog/emissive) being pixel-faithful; (3) no drop-in WebGPU replacement for **god-rays / SSAO / SMAA** from `postprocessing`.                                                                                                                    |
| **Recommendation**                      | **Worth a time-boxed spike, not a blind commit.** Do [Phase 0](04-migration-plan.md#phase-0--the-spike-1-2-weeks) first: a throwaway branch that renders the _static world only_ (one TSL material, no post-FX) under WebGPU with render bundles, and **measure the draw-submission ms**. If it collapses as predicted → green-light the full migration. If render bundles don't deliver in three 0.177 → stop, cheap. |

This is the only direction in the whole investigation that both **fixes the problem at its root** and **doesn't
require sacrificing visual quality**. But it is a real engine rewrite — go in with the spike, eyes open.
