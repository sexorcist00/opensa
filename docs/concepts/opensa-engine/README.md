# Concept: OpenSA engine — own framework, own formats, 60 fps

**Question:** can a purpose-built engine (own WebGPU renderer + own texture/model formats + offline tools) deliver
**60 fps with the FULL current WebGL effect set** on the same world data?

**Status: 🌱 CONCEPT (2026-07-11).** Born from the parked [073 WebGPU migration](../../plans/073-webgpu-migration-threejs/readme.md):
the campaign proved the browser is NOT the limit — the framework and the data shape are. Every number below is a
field measurement from that campaign, not an estimate.

## Why this is credible (measured foundations)

| Claim                                            | Evidence (ours, this hardware — M3 Pro)                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Browser WebGPU submits a full SA scene for ~free | Babylon Snapshot FAST: **0.12 ms** CPU @ 15k draws; our patched three bundles: 4–5 ms _while fighting the framework_                                                                                                               |
| The GPU cost of the PICTURE is small             | vanilla SA runs 100+ fps on this class of hardware; our 31 ms WebGL GPU is state-churn + unbatched draws + retina post — not the pixels                                                                                            |
| The pathologies were three's, not the platform's | per-object pipelines (uuid cache key), naga uniform-array occupancy collapse (~250 ms), unexplained Metal present overhead — all located INSIDE the framework (073/08 forensic log)                                                |
| The data half is already designed                | the [066 tool chain](../../plans/066-pmb-modern-tool/readme.md) specs the native cell format, batching, baked shadows/AO/emissive — it was parked because it fed _three-WebGL_; it is exactly the asset pipeline this engine needs |

**Why 066 batching "didn't work" before and will now:** the tooling experiment measured −23 % against the 65 ms
draw-submission wall — batching couldn't pay while every draw cost 4.4 µs of three-WebGL overhead. In an engine
whose submission is ~free and whose draws are _designed_ to be few, batching is not an optimization — it is the
data model.

---

## The three pillars

### 1. Data: everything expensive happens offline (extends the 066 chain)

- **Cells, pre-batched at build time.** One cell = a handful of draws (opaque groups by texture-array page ×
  blend class × side flags, plus separate timed/breakable/animated objects). Interleaved vertex buffers,
  meshopt-compressed, GPU-ready (worker → transferable → `queue.writeBuffer`, zero main-thread parsing).
  Vertex channels: position, normal, uv, day prelit, night prelit, AO/skyVis, emissive mask, sway weight —
  the whole current lighting model rides vertex data we already know how to bake.
- **Textures: texture ARRAYS, not atlas pages.** The 066 experiment measured atlases losing (−7 %) because GTA
  UVs TILE (repeat wrapping) — atlasing breaks tiling. `texture2d_array` layers keep native per-layer tiling
  while letting one bind group cover a whole batch group. Same-size-class textures pack into shared arrays;
  odd sizes get padded or bucketed.
- **The alpha pipeline — kills [alpha-edge](../../open-issues/alpha-edge.md) BY CONSTRUCTION:**
  1. **Offline classification** per texture: `opaque` / `cutout` / `soft-blend` (analysis of real alpha
     content — no runtime `hasAlpha` heuristics).
  2. **Premultiplied alpha everywhere.** The black fringe exists because we filter NON-premultiplied data with
     black transparent texels; filtering premultiplied data is mathematically correct — transparent texels
     contribute exactly nothing. This is the complete fix the issue doc reaches for, plus:
  3. **Offline mips**: edge dilation at the base level (already prototyped in the issue) + alpha-weighted
     downsampling for the chain — three's straight-average `generateMipmaps` (the second half of the root
     cause) simply doesn't exist here.
  4. **Alpha-to-coverage for cutouts** — our renderer owns MSAA (the current post-FX path couldn't), which is
     exactly the soft-foliage-edge tool the issue's approach #1 lacked.
  - Encode: BC7 (quality alpha, universal desktop WebGPU support) with BC1 for opaque; own container or KTX2 —
    either way WE generate the mip chain.
- **Own pak with range reads** (replaces holding the ~1 GB IMG ArrayBuffer in JS — the memory-pressure lesson).

### 2. Renderer: small, owned, WebGPU-native

- **Draw model:** ~50 visible cells × 2–6 draws = **100–300 draws/frame** (vs 14 454). At that count native
  bundles are almost optional — but we record per-cell bundles anyway (proven granularity from Phase 1a) and
  keep pipelines in the DOZENS (we own every cache key; the entire pipeline set compiles behind the load veil —
  cold-start storms are impossible by design).
- **Bind scheme:** per-frame UBO (camera/sun/fog/time) · per-pass · per-batch-group (texture array + params) ·
  per-draw (object/cell transform). Local-light pool as a data texture (the trick field-proven in 073).
- **Frame graph:** opaque (front-to-back, A2C cutouts) → sky → transparents (per-cell sorted, premultiplied) →
  water → particles/coronas → post (bloom → god-rays → ACES; MSAA resolve replaces SMAA).
- **Memory:** GPU-resident everything; JS holds handles, not payloads (the 3.5 GB lesson).
- **Diagnosability:** the frame-segment HUD + GPU timestamp queries from day one — the 073 campaign's core
  process lesson (render CPU is not the frame).

### 3. Runtime: gameplay stays, the renderer is swapped under it

Streaming (cells/rings/hysteresis/workers), physics (rapier), character/vehicles logic, zones/time/weather —
all framework-agnostic today and stay as-is. The engine boundary is narrow: "here are GPU-ready cell blobs,
here are dynamic entities with transforms/skins". The existing three-WebGL prod path REMAINS INTACT during the
whole build-out (additive, no flag day — 066 ground rule).

## Risks — honest

1. **Scope:** 2–4 focused months (comparable to the abandoned three-WebGPU full port, but with zero black boxes —
   the decisive difference, as 073 proved).
2. **Dynamics parity is the grind** (skinning/IFP/vehicle damage states) — schedule it early, not last.
3. **Safari/iOS WebGPU** maturity; BC7 + A2C are fine on Apple GPUs, but test early. Fallback = the intact
   three-WebGL path (which can ALSO consume the batched cells for a free interim win).
4. **Bake times/tooling** — mitigated by existing pmb/map-optimizer infrastructure and the 066 specs.
5. **The unknown unknowns of owning a renderer** — mitigated by the 073 instrumentation discipline: every phase
   gates on measured numbers, never on vibes.

## Phasing (each phase gates on a number)

- **P0 — spike (1–2 wks):** hand-written mini-renderer + minimal cell converter for one district; bundles +
  texture arrays + A2C. **Gate: that district at 2× retina in <5 ms GPU, <1 ms submit.** Also the alpha-edge
  visual check (vgsebushes / fences) — the premultiplied pipeline should kill the fringe in P0 already.
- **P1 — formats + tools:** execute the 066 chain (01 format, 02 batching, 03 baked shadows, 04 channels) against
  the new target; full alpha pipeline; pak + range reads.
- **P2 — world parity:** streaming feeds the new renderer; sky/fog/sun/baked shadows/local lights/emissives.
- **P3 — dynamics:** character skinning + IFP, vehicles, particles, water.
- **P4 — post + tiers + A/B vs WebGL prod;** flip the default only when better on every bench scene.
