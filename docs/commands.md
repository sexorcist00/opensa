# Commands cheat sheet

The everyday commands with all their params, in one place. Canonical folders:
**source game** `./game-src/original` · **mods** `./mods-src` · **canonical build** `./build/original`
(see [architecture/perfect-map-builder.md](./architecture/perfect-map-builder.md)).
Rule (also in `CLAUDE.md`): when a command or param is added/changed, update this file.

## The one build, per TARGET

A build is asked for by target, not as a whole — the two are independent and the opensa one is rebuilt far
more often, so it does not pay for the real game's LOD pass:

```bash
npm run build:game:original:opensa     # our target only  (pmb --exclude sa) + fetch-pack
npm run build:game:original:sa         # the real game    (pmb --exclude opensa — every stage, both asis)
npm run build:game:gostown:opensa      # TCs are opensa-only (also :carcer :anderius)
```

Both write into the same `./build/<id>`: `:opensa` fills `opensa/` + `opensa-pack/`, `:sa` fills `sa/`, and
neither touches the other's directory (the builder only clears its own `<out>/.work-<target>`, plus a legacy
shared `.work` if one is left from a pre-005 build).

**`<out>/.work-<target>` is wiped before any stage reads `--game`** (pmb plan 005: one work dir per target,
so building one target keeps the other's intermediates), so re-running one stage off an intermediate
(`--game <out>/.work-sa/5-trees`) inside the SAME target's dir deletes the intermediate first. Copy it out,
point `--out` elsewhere, or read the OTHER target's kept dir — the builder refuses the overlap rather than
wiping it. Every run writes `<out>/build-timings.json` — per-stage wall clock plus the target and procobj
knobs it was built with, so two durations are comparable, plus `startedAt`/`finishedAt` and a `status`. **A run
that DIES writes it too**, with `status: "failed"`, the step that threw and the stages that had finished; both
it and this run's `report-<target>.json` are cleared on entry, so nothing an earlier run left can be read as
this one's. Each target that runs writes
`<out>/report-<target>.json` (`report-sa.json`, `report-opensa.json`): the target, the fetch game id, the
timings and one typed fragment per stage that produced one (optimize totals; the sa census/FLA pools/lift
requirements/asi sha; the pack summary with a POINTER to `opensa/pak/report.json` — there is no root
`report.json` any more). Standalone:

```bash
NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=12288 npx tsx tools/perfect-map-builder/src/cli.ts \
  --game ./game-src/original --in ./mods-src --exclude sa
```

Params: `--out <dir>` (default `./build/original`) · `--until <split|mods|vehicles|cutscene|add-vehicles|peds|optimize|trees|sa|procobj|opensa|pack|lod>` (that IS the run order — `procobj` is baked inside the `sa` branch since plan 014, so `--until sa` stops BEFORE the clutter; `cutscene` is the vehicles stage's shadow and drops out with `--exclude vehicles`)
(inclusive, keeps `.work-<target>/`) · **`--exclude <stage,stage>`** · **`--target <sa|opensa>`** ·
`--procobj-density <n>` · `--procobj-max <n>` · `--keep-work` · `--no-weld-seams` · `--no-textures` ·
**`--bake-collision`** (write every cell's collision into the pak — plan
200/3-01; off by default, and the same tree built with and without it is the A/B the claim is read on: the
runtime reads a bake when the pak has one and parses COL when it does not).

**`--resume`** — re-enter a FAILED run at its last finished step (`<out>/.work-<target>/resume.json`; the pack
re-enters at its last finished weld chunk); refused if the sources, flags or code changed since that run
(pmb plan 006).

`--exclude` says WHICH STAGES run where `--until` is the stop point: it drops the named stages and keeps
everything after them (repeatable, comma-separated, same names as `--until` minus the `lod` alias; an unknown
name is an error, never a silent skip). Excluding `opensa` drops `pack` with it; excluding `pack` alone leaves
`opensa/` in GAME format; excluding `sa` also drops its `checkImgIdBudgets` guard, which reads the `sa/` tree.
**`:sa` builds everything but the opensa target** since 2026-08-15 — it stopped excluding `vehicles,peds` when the
cutscene stage began shipping a plugin paired with its fleet: a "real game" build that silently carried neither is
the trap. Measured end to end at 638.9 s.

`--target` says which HOST the build is for, and it picks every knob whose right value is a fact about the
host rather than about the source data (limits, particle policy, procobj density). Omit it and it is DERIVED
from `--exclude` — `--exclude sa` builds for `opensa`, anything that still builds `sa/` is `sa`, because the
common chain is shared and its content has to satisfy the host that still has ceilings. `--target opensa`
without `--exclude sa` is refused for the same reason. The run prints the target it resolved, and the procobj
stage prints that layer's price against it (objects · permanent text rows · rows/object).
NB `--target` means a DIRECTORY in `vehicle-installer --rebake` — same word, unrelated meaning; there the
layer of a LAYERED vehicles folder is picked by `--kind`. `vehicle-installer`/`ped-installer`/`vehicle-cutscene`
`--target sa|opensa` and `cars-server --target` (default `sa`) pick the layer of a layered `--in`
(`common/sa/opensa`, same planner as mods — 2026-08-17).

`--procobj-density` is the scatter density cutoff for the procobj stage — **1 = vanilla, max 3** (the
scatter's candidate ceiling; above it there are no candidates left to keep and the build refuses). The run
prints the density it built at, so a capture states its own configuration. **The flag is the whole-map
number; a PROFILE** — per category and per category×surface, plus a `maxDensity` that raises the candidate
ceiling — **is a config value, not a flag** (`BuilderConfig.procobjDensity` / `ProcObjLodConfig.density`
accept `number | ProcObjDensityConfig`). The build then prints every key (`base=1 rocks=2`) and a
per-category `objects / candidates / taken by the cap` breakdown. One density for both targets: it is not
keyed by host. `--procobj-max` raises the placed
-object safety cap with it; without that a high-density run measures the CAP, and the build says so with a
`CAP DROPPED n` line. **The 2026-08-08 finding that "the cutoff is not the density lever" is retired**: it was
true only because `cullByMinDistance` was deleting 99 % of the candidates with a column that is a camera
distance. Since [009](../tools/sa-procobj-placement/docs/plans/009-procobj-dat-columns-as-the-game-reads-them.md)
density 1 IS the authored density (91 092 objects) and `procObjMax` defaults to 100 000 so it does not bind.

An `sa` build also **ships `perfect-map.asi` into the built game root** (sha256 recorded in
`build-timings.json`, so a map is paired with the exact asi that lifts its ceilings). The artifact comes from
`asi/perfect-map/dist/` — build it with `npm run build:asi` in that workspace, which needs MinGW; `dist/` is
gitignored, so a fresh checkout has none and the build **warns loudly** instead of quietly emitting a tree
that corrupts a plain install.

On the built `sa/` tree the build also prints its **install requirements** — every stock ceiling the artifact
crosses and the setting that lifts it (int16 rows → `perfect-map.asi`, which no adjuster provides; the
`CBuilding` pool → OLA `Buildings`; rows in one IPL → OLA `EntitiesPerIpl`; the three FLA id pools). A LINE,
never a throw: the ceilings that are REAL on the target are guarded beside it, and this one states the ones we
deliberately design past, so the install a build needs is read off the artifact rather than remembered.

On the built `sa/` tree the build prints a **map-cost census** (`reportTextIplCensus`: permanent text-IPL rows,
inst-bearing IPLs, and how many of the IPLs listed in `gta.dat` it could actually read) and enforces the **FLA
ID pools** (`checkImgIdBudgets` — the one set of ceilings the target really has). An `--exclude sa` run does
neither. There is no int16 row guard any more: the target always runs `perfect-map.asi` + OLA + FLA, so that
ceiling is lifted where our data lands — `--allow-text-row-overflow` was deleted with it (2026-08-09).

The chain opens with **`split`** (img-splitter): `models/gta3.img` is divided into typed archives BEFORE
anything installs, so every entry name lives in exactly one of them. `BuilderConfig.splitBuckets` picks which
buckets get their own file and defaults to `['vehicles']` — the shape that fits a stock archive table exactly
(SA registers 8, the target already spends 6, and the mod car set spills `vehicles.img` into one sibling).
Whoever writes an archive registers it in `gta.dat`, and the finished `sa/` tree is gated against the 8:
past it the game does not warn, it crashes at load. A tool asks **where** a file lives through
`openArchiveIndex` rather than opening `gta3.img` by name; `data/img-layout.json` beside it is a REPORT for
readers outside the build, never the lookup. See
[architecture/img-archive-layout.md](./architecture/img-archive-layout.md).

The `sa/` tree carries **the asis its content requires**, into the game root: `perfect-map.asi` always, and
`perfect-cutscene.asi` when the cutscene stage ran (the fleet and the plugin are coupled — panes on every
slot with no plugin is the draw-order roulette back). Both are pre-built artifacts under a gitignored
`dist/` (`npm run build:asi` in `asi/perfect-map` / `asi/perfect-cutscene`, MinGW); a missing one WARNS and
does not fail the build, and each shipped one is hashed into `report-sa.json` and `build-timings.json` so a
tree states which plugin build it is paired with.

### One model changed: swap it in place instead of rebuilding

```bash
# REAL-SA tree: HD through the optimizer chain + its clone LOD cut from the result, patched into the tree's IMGs
npx tsx scripts/debug/model-lab.ts <model> --tree build/original/sa [--dff f.dff --txd f.txd] [--dry]
npx tsx scripts/debug/img-patch.ts restore <model>.dff --game build/original/sa      # undo, per entry
# OPENSA tree: the model re-optimized, its rect's CELL LODs re-baked from the swapped HD, the rect re-welded
# into a servable LAB pak (never the shipping pak) — 17 s for an 88-model rect on original
NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=12288 npx tsx scripts/debug/model-repack.ts <model> --game original [--dff f.dff [--txd f.txd]] [--no-lod]
npm run serve:static   # then the app with ?src=/build/original/opensa-lab
```

The full pipeline is the LAST resort — to confirm a fix on the whole tree after the one-model verdict, or for a
change with no one-model form. Rows and levers: [`docs/debug/README.md`](debug/README.md).

### A build that died: resume it

```bash
# same flags as the run that died, plus --resume — re-enters at the last finished step (a dead pack at its
# last finished weld chunk); refused, naming the difference, if sources / flags / git HEAD changed since that
# run (a DIRTY tree at the same HEAD is allowed — fix the bug that killed it, resume). The pack's model classes
# after the weld re-run (~9 min on original — docs/in-reserve/opensa-pack-model-class-checkpoints.md).
# Field-exercised 2026-08-17: killed at weld chunk 6/21, resumed at 7/21, byte-identical to an unbroken run.
NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=12288 npx tsx tools/perfect-map-builder/src/cli.ts \
  --game ./game-src/original --in ./mods-src/original --out ./build/original --exclude sa --resume
```

### Added vehicles — new model ids on a built `sa` tree

```bash
# Everything mods-src/<game>/add-vehicles holds, into a BUILT sa tree, in place
npx tsx tools/add-vehicles/src/cli.ts --game build/original/sa
npx tsx tools/add-vehicles/src/cli.ts --game build/original/sa --only 001veh,059veh
npx tsx tools/add-vehicles/src/cli.ts --game build/original/sa --plan     # resolve and report, write nothing
```

`sa` only — every part of an added car is a plugin of the real game (ModelVariations for traffic, FLA's
audio loader, Parked Maker, CLEO's FXT loader). Ids come from **19 001–19 999** and are pinned by
`data/vehicle-adds.txt`, so a rebuild never renumbers the fleet (a parked spot and a variation land in the
SAVE). Also a pmb stage (`--until add-vehicles`), after `cutscene`. Central plan
[102](../tools/add-vehicles/docs/plans/102-add-vehicles/readme.md); tuning rate and exclusions live in an optional
`mods-src/<game>/add-vehicles/add-vehicles.json`.

### Vehicle round: rebake instead of rebuilding

```bash
# Re-install + re-convert the mod cars of an ALREADY BUILT game, in place (one car ≈ 3.6 s)
npx tsx tools/vehicle-installer/src/cli.ts --rebake gostown --only previon
npx tsx tools/vehicle-installer/src/cli.ts --rebake gostown            # every mod car of that game
# The same against the REAL-SA tree: raw dff/txd replaced by name in vehicles.img + vehicles2.img (one car ≈ 4 s)
npx tsx tools/vehicle-installer/src/cli.ts --rebake original --kind sa --only cabbie
```

Defaults: `--kind opensa` · `--target build/<game>/<kind>` · `--in mods-src/<game>/vehicles` (all
overridable). `--kind sa` installs instead of converting ([plan 008](../tools/vehicle-installer/docs/plans/008-rebake-sa.md));
each kind refuses the other's tree by what the archive holds. **Which cars
that folder holds**: every subfolder of a flat tree, or `models/` overridden per SLOT by `new/` in a
structured one — drop a candidate into `new/` and every vehicle command takes it instead of the incumbent,
with nothing renamed or deleted ([plan 007](../tools/vehicle-installer/docs/plans/007-models-and-new.md),
contract `docs/contracts/vehicles.md` §1). Per car it
merges its `*.settings.txt` into the BUILT `data/*`, merges its `features.txt` line into
`data/vehicle-features.txt`, re-converts its `dff`/`txd` and REPLACES `<model>.osm` in whichever
`models/*.img` holds it. Idempotent, and it touches nothing else in the tree.
It can also **ADD a car the built game never had**, when the mod declares its own `vehicles.ide` row: the
roster is text and a spawn resolves `<model>.osm` by name, so nothing about a car is baked into the pak. The
tool never allocates an id (it must match what a full build would write) and refuses one that already belongs
to another model. An added car has no traffic or parked presence until a full build writes the placements —
spawn it by name to look at it ([plan 006](../tools/vehicle-installer/docs/plans/006-rebake.md)).

### What the fleet replaced, in a browser

```bash
npm run cars                                # http://localhost:5178, game `original`, target `sa`
npm run cars:sa                             # a LAYERED vehicles folder: common + sa (cars AND screenshots)
npm run cars:opensa                         # … common + opensa
npm run cars -- --game gostown --port 5200 [--target sa|opensa]
```

One local page per game: every installed car with its model id, `<slot> replaced to: <car>`, the author,
what the mod brings (paint jobs · tuning · new colours · car4 · a CLEO script), and the stock picture beside
the field screenshot. Rendered per request off `mods-src/<game>/vehicles`, so a reload shows the tree as it
is now; a `new/` candidate appears marked `from new/`. The header names the TARGET; on a layered tree each car's
screenshot comes from its OWN layer's `screenshots/` (`common/` or `<target>/`, `.png`/`.jpg`/`.webp` alike —
never the other layer's picture under the same slot), on a flat/structured one from `screenshots/` and the
target does not apply; a car with no screenshot is a warning at the top of the page naming the file to save
([readme](../scripts/cars-server/readme.md), [plan](../scripts/cars-server/docs/plans/001-cars-server.md),
[plan 002](../scripts/cars-server/docs/plans/002-layered-screenshots.md)).

### Cutscene vehicles: census / conversion

```bash
# which cutscene models exist, which mod is the donor, is everything in place (writes nothing):
npx tsx tools/vehicle-cutscene/src/cli.ts --game game-src/original --in mods-src/original/vehicles --inspect
# convert the fleet into an output game (base copied; cutscene.img rebuilt; txdcut.ide patched;
# anim/cuts.img re-emitted when two SCENE-VALUE passes find work — the wheel-stash sink and the seat
# retarget, both reported per row in the summary):
npx tsx tools/vehicle-cutscene/src/cli.ts --game game-src/original --in mods-src/original/vehicles --out <dir>
# emit ONLY the three files the tool writes, into a folder of your own (--out is NOT wiped, and must
# not be the game itself). The field-delivery shape: 579 MiB instead of a 1.72 GiB game tree, and the
# three files are byte-identical to the copy run (plan 006):
npx tsx tools/vehicle-cutscene/src/cli.ts --game game-src/original --in mods-src/original/vehicles --out <dir> --no-base-copy
# --only bobcat,cszr350 restricts slots; --self-contained-txd embeds each MOD's TXD (for a target whose
# gameplay stays stock, e.g. the reference bottle). All three branches convert (car/bike/boat) —
# the full 23-model fleet; ~3.5 s wall-clock, ~2.4 s with --no-base-copy (docs/benchmarks/tools/).
# Plated slots get a READABLE license plate baked into the cs TXD (vanilla cutscenes show blanks):
# --plate <text> overrides the per-slot deterministic text, --plate-town <ls|sf|lv> picks the background
```

Field delivery to the reference bottle = drop `models/cutscene.img` + `data/txdcut.ide` in (originals
renamed to `.vanilla` beside them) — the bottle streams cutscene.img directly, no modloader override
([gta-sa-original/cutscenes.md](gta-sa-original/cutscenes.md)).

23 cutscene vehicle models / 21 donor slots; the census derives from `models/cutscene.img` +
`data/txdcut.ide` + `data/vehicles.ide`, never a hardcoded list
([plans](../tools/vehicle-cutscene/docs/plans/)).

### The same conversion as a Windows app (apps/cutscene-converter)

```bash
npm run dev -w @opensa/cutscene-converter        # vite + esbuild + Electron, window on macOS
npm run build -w @opensa/cutscene-converter      # asi resource, main bundle, renderer; FAILS with no asi
npm run pack:win -w @opensa/cutscene-converter   # the portable exe into apps/cutscene-converter/release/
```

A facade over the tool above — it forks the very same CLI with `--no-base-copy --self-contained-txd`, so
its output is byte-identical to the command line's. `perfect-cutscene.asi` is embedded at build time and
the build refuses to run without it ([README](../apps/cutscene-converter/README.md)).

## Serving & running

```bash
npm run dev                 # Vite dev server → http://localhost:5173
npm run serve:static        # static origin :3001 — mounts /build + /game-src (Range + /__index), static/ archives
npm run phone:setup         # ONCE per device: deps, tsx, the prebuilt app, and what is still missing
npm run phone               # the whole phone run in ONE command (convert if needed → check the pak → serve → print the URL)
npm run build:embed:dispatch # → dist-embed/ — the dispatch MAP as one ES module, for an external host
```

**Two commands is the whole phone workflow**: `npm run phone:setup` once, then `npm run phone` for every run
after. Setup is idempotent — re-running it after a failure, a pulled commit or a reboot costs seconds and
repeats nothing — and it installs only; the pak is `npm run phone`'s business because that is the expensive
half. It uses `HUSKY=0` rather than editing `package.json` to get past the `prepare` hook, so the worktree
stays clean on the one machine where `git status` is hardest to read.

`npm run phone` (`scripts/phone.sh`, plan 200 chain 4) is the field-run ritual for a device, written so the
command never changes and every knob is an env var: `REBUILD=1` re-converts, `BAKE=0` builds the other side of
the collision A/B, `TEXTURES=` picks the texture format (default `astc`; `rgba8` is the A/B's other side),
`MODELS=0` skips the model convert (fast, but then only `dispatch.html` is usable — it runs
no physics), `VEHICLES=` / `PEDS=` set the model SUBSET (default `admiral,infernus,comet` + `bmycg,wmycr`;
`all` converts the roster — hours on a phone), `ASTC_THREADS=` caps astcenc's worker pool (default 2 — the library's one-per-core is what OOMs a phone), `DISTRICT=` picks the measurement district — its rect, its
spawn and the map's opening point at once, from the table the console reads (`npx tsx scripts/district.ts`
lists them; the default is the one 201/1-01 pinned), `RECT=` / `SPAWN=` / `OUT=` / `GAME=` / `APP_PORT=` /
`STATIC_PORT=` move the rest, and `MAPOBJ=0` turns off the district lever (`--map-objects-in-rect`, on by
default here: convert only the map objects the rect PLACES instead of all ~14 000 the IDEs name — the slowest
stage of a district convert). It converts
only when there is no pak (a phone convert is minutes to hours), prints what the pak actually carries — the
collision GRID first, then what its textures cost — and reuses a server that is already up. **When it reuses a
pak it first asks that pak whether it is the one being requested** (`scripts/debug/pak-recipe.ts` against
`report.json`'s `build` block) and refuses to serve a mismatch, naming both sides: before that check,
`RECT=… npm run phone` over an existing pak served the OLD district in silence, because the knobs are read
only on the convert branch. Ctrl+C (or closing the Termux session) stops
the servers it started. A prebuilt app in `build/webapp` (or `WEBAPP=<dir>`) is served as static files and
vite is not started at all — which is the only way in on a device whose rolldown binding crashes
([edge-cases/browser-runtime.md](./edge-cases/browser-runtime.md)). A ready archive is committed:
`tar -xzf prebuilt/opensa-webapp.tar.gz -C build/webapp` ([prebuilt/](../prebuilt/README.md)). Full phone recipe: [development/mobile-pak.md](./development/mobile-pak.md).

| sa-map-viewer: the sea   | on by default; `&water=0` hides it (the panel has "Show water") — scripted shots add `water=0` themselves |
| dispatch console         | `npm run dev` → `http://localhost:5173/dispatch.html` (defaults to `?src=build/original`) — the CAD surface: top-down map, live units, call queue, click-to-inspect |
| dispatch: no build       | `…/dispatch.html?demo=1` — a synthetic block city, no pak needed (and no model names on click) |
| dispatch: a PHONE pak    | `npx tsx tools/opensa-pack/src/cli.ts --game ./game-src/original --out ./build/district --textures astc --max-texture 256 --rect 8,-8,11,-5 --no-ao --no-models` → serve it and open `dispatch.html?src=build/district&at=2495,-1687`. `--textures astc` is what makes the pak loadable on a GPU without BC (every mobile one) at one byte per texel; `--textures rgba8` is the portable-but-4x fallback and `--max-texture N` takes back three quarters of ITS cost; `--rect` keeps the rest affordable. Full recipe, including building on the phone in Termux: [development/mobile-pak.md](./development/mobile-pak.md). Cells are `floor(worldXY / 250)` and **Los Santos sits at NEGATIVE GTA y** — `8,-8,11,-5` is x 2000…3000, y −2000…−1250 (Ganton/Idlewood); the whole of LS is about `1,-10,11,-3` |
| dispatch: a pose         | `…&at=1700,-1500&h=900&pitch=-66&yaw=180` (GTA x,y · height · degrees) — same convention as sa-map-viewer |
| dispatch: world knobs    | `&src=<built game>` · `&hd=450&lod=2200` streaming rings · `&hour=10` · `&weather=0` · `&fogscale=2.5` · `&fog=1` restores the game's fog (off by default, or a city view culls every cell) |
| dispatch: board size     | `&units=150&calls=40` — seed the board at 201's declared worst case instead of the nine-car demo shift, which is how the symbology numbers 201/5-02 owes get taken (pair with `&inventory=1`; the report's `symbology` block says what actually reached the screen). Deterministic — the generated roster is a hash of its index, so two runs of the same size are the same board |
| dispatch: embedded       | `npm run build:embed:dispatch` → `dist-embed/dispatch.js` **plus `assets/pak-worker-*.js`, which must be served beside it at the path the entry names**. A host imports the module, calls `bootDispatch` / `bootPlanMode`, and configures it through `window.__opensaDispatch` — NOT the address bar, which belongs to the host. `&src=` accepts an absolute URL, so a hosted pak needs no local game files: [features/dispatch-console.md](./features/dispatch-console.md#embedding-it) |

# Mods → game dir. Two shapes of --in (docs/contracts/mods.md §1): FLAT (every subfolder is a mod, today's

#   --blend-cards <n>  cards for the REAL-SA set (default 3), which composites them in its sorted pass; the

#   then solved per tree so the composite covers what that tree's own HD covers (plan 013 step 06).
#   --ss <n>  sub-samples per atlas texel on each axis, a power of two (default 2, 1 = off). The card bake
#   has no MSAA, so a thin leaf quad takes a texel whole or misses it — the atlas speckle plan 013 measured.
#   Bake-time only, and it grows with the SQUARE: ×7.1 at 2, ×25 at 4 (docs/benchmarks/tools/2026-08-21-…).

# Procobj → static IPL + LODs ([--target sa|opensa]: the host the layer's cost is reported against; pmb passes

#   --species-floor <n>  objects every species with a candidate is guaranteed per 250 u cell (default 1, 0 = off).
#   Its own gate, WIDER than the runtime's: nothing caps this path, so what empties a species locally is the

npx tsx tools/opensa-lod-generator/src/cli.ts --game <dir> --out <dir> --cell 250
#   --cell MUST equal the pak's 250 render grid: a mismatched bake puts an object's HD and LOD in different

#   --pak-out: where the pak products land (default: <out>/pak — the game dir is self-contained, 086 phase 8)
#   --checkpoints <dir> [--resume]: per-chunk weld checkpoints; --resume continues from them (pmb plan 006)

#   --bake-collision: write every cell's collision into the pak (.oscol v2, on the GAME grid 256 -- NOT the
#     render grid 250) so the browser never parses a COL, and resolve the breakable gate here too (the
#     per-placement instance keys ride along, so the runtime opens no DFF either). The runtime READS this
#     since 200/3-01; a cell without an entry falls back to parsing COL. Off by default: it costs build time
#   --platforms: ASSERT the build runs on the named GPU families, and fail the pack when it does not. Every
#     run reports the demand anyway (report.json `platforms`, and one log line): world arrays ∪ model
#     dictionaries, because a car is NOT in the pak — an --rgba8 world can still be unspawnable on a phone
#   --textures: the format the build WRITES, for the world AND every model dictionary (200/2-02).
#     bc (default) passes SA's DXT through untouched, desktop-only. astc re-encodes to ASTC 4x4 — one byte
#     per texel (the same as BC3, a QUARTER of rgba8) on the GPUs that have no BC; it costs build time and
#     one generation of loss. rgba8 leaves the pixels uncompressed: portable, 4x an astc payload.
#     `--rgba8` is the older spelling of `--textures rgba8`; passing both when they DISAGREE is an error

## ASI plugins (real SA, cross-compiled — needs `brew install mingw-w64`)

```bash
# Build a plugin. Every plugin gets these three via asi/sdk's Makefile fragment.
npm run build:asi    -w @opensa/perfect-map-asi   # shipping: APPLY, both fixes → dist/perfect-map.asi
npm run build:verify -w @opensa/perfect-map-asi   # DRY RUN: patches nothing, logs every site's verdict
npm run build:debug  -w @opensa/perfect-map-asi   # APPLY + verbose site dump + the plugin's own traces
npm run gen          -w @opensa/perfect-map-asi   # catalogue.ts → src/generated/patches.hpp only

# The second plugin: deferred cutscene alpha (glass over scene actors) → dist/perfect-cutscene.asi
npm run build:asi    -w @opensa/perfect-cutscene-asi
npm run build:verify -w @opensa/perfect-cutscene-asi   # what a bring-up step installs: verifies, writes nothing

# Per-fix bisection (the flags are the plugin's; EXTRA_CXXFLAGS is the SDK's knob)
make -C asi/perfect-map APPLY=1 EXTRA_CXXFLAGS='-DPM_FIX_INT16=1 -DPM_FIX_FX2DFX=0'
# DEBUG=1 without APPLY=1 is refused: every debug switch is read inside an APPLY build.

# Reproducible artifact for an A/B — pin BOTH the PE timestamps (already in the link line) and the
# banner's __DATE__/__TIME__, or two builds a second apart differ:
SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH=315532800 make -C asi/perfect-map clean && \
  SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH=315532800 make -C asi/perfect-map APPLY=1
```

The verdict lives in `perfect-map-asi.log` next to `gta_sa.exe`. **Read its first line before anything
else** — `built <date> <time> (APPLY|verify-only)` is the only thing identifying which artifact the game
actually loaded, and a verify-only build patches nothing.
