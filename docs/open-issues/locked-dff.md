# "Locked" (anti-rip protected) DFF models

## FALSE ALARM logged for the record: "Variant E" (2026-07-15) was OUR parser bug, not a lock

The LV Casino Royale family (`casroyale01..04_lvs`, `flamingo04/05_lvs`, `vegaswaterfall02`, `gym_bike` —
all from "0. Map Fixes Pack", healthy 2015 exports) writes the geometry struct's **UV-layer-count BYTE as 0**
and carries the truth in the `TEXTURED`/`TEXTURED2` flags — a legal RenderWare convention (RW derives the
count from the flags when the byte is 0). Both our readers trusted the bare byte, skipped the UV block and
read the TRIANGLES out of UV float data — garbage indices (max 64512 for 1418 verts) that perfectly
masqueraded as a poisoned-triangle-list lock. Cost: three field rounds (vanished casino → shard fields), a
BinMesh "salvage" and a vanilla-substitution mechanism, ALL REVERTED once the real cause surfaced.

Fixed in BOTH readers: `packages/renderware/src/parsers/binary/dff.ts#parseGeometry` and
`tools/rw-codec/src/geometry-struct.ts#decodeGeometryStruct` (the latter was the
"Offset is outside the bounds of the DataView" write failures). Layer count = byte, else TEXTURED2 → 2,
TEXTURED → 1, else 0. Fixture: `tests/custom/locked-models/casroyale01_lvs.dff` (pins 1 UV layer, 1011
in-range triangles, full 6389 u² surface, 12 materials).

Diagnostic lesson: before declaring a new LOCK variant, verify the file against a KNOWN-GOOD reader
convention (RW derives many counts from flags) — "garbage indices" from a boundary-respecting parser can be
our own offset drift.

## Variant A — inflated item sizes (`yosemite.dff`)

The clump declares 31 atomics / 31 geometries, but **every atomic and geometry chunk's declared size is
bloated** to swallow the items that follow (with `0x0` size-0 padding chunks interleaved). A
boundary-respecting walk advances by each bloated size and so finds only **8 atomics / 16 geometries**;
the 8 it sees index geometries `0, 2, 6, 10, 14, 19, 23, 27` (up to 27 — out of range for the 16 it
walked). The other items are **all present**, nested inside the bloated ranges.

RW reads each list by its **count** via `RwStreamFindChunk`, scanning forward (skipping the padding and
ignoring the bloated sizes) and advancing past each item's _real_ content — so it finds all 31 atomics
(indices `0…30`) and all 31 geometries (verts 1716, 1772, …, 2314; last ends exactly on the geomlist
boundary). That is why the game renders the truck whole.

**Recovered the same way:** `parseDff` / `parseGeometryList` keep the fast boundary walk, but when the
declared count exceeds what it found they re-read RW-style via `findChunkFrom` + `contentEnd` (struct +
[matlist] + extension). Triggers only on the count mismatch → no change for well-formed files.

## Variant B — inflated clump-struct size (`cheetah.dff`)

Here the **clump's first child (the Struct, `0x01`) declares size `16777228` (`0x0100000C`)** instead of
the real **`12` (`0x0C`)** — the high byte is tampered to `0x01`. A size-trusting walk seeks ~16 MB past
the struct, sees **only the struct**, and misses the FrameList, GeometryList, all 57 atomics, and the
Extension holding the `COL3` chunk. Fixed by `forEachClumpChild`: when the leading Struct overshoots the
clump it uses the canonical 12-byte SA clump-struct payload and resumes sibling iteration after it.
RenderWare survives the same way — it reads the struct's fixed fields directly and ignores the bogus size.

## Variant B — inflated struct size (`cheetah.dff`)

Here the data is all present, but the **clump's first child (the Struct, `0x01`) declares size
`16777228` (`0x0100000C`)** instead of the real **`12` (`0x0C`)** — the high byte is tampered to
`0x01`. Our `forEachChild` trusts that size and seeks ~16 MB past the struct, so it sees **only the
struct** and misses the FrameList, GeometryList, all 57 atomics, and the Extension holding the `COL3`
chunk (present at offset 11889056). Result:

- `parseDff(cheetah.dff)` → **0 frames / 0 atomics / 0 geometries** (empty model).
- `parseDffCollision` → `null` (the COL is inside the missed Extension).

RenderWare survives because it reads the clump struct's fixed fields directly and **ignores the bogus
size**, then finds each following chunk by scanning — so the game loads it. Unlike Variant A, the data
is **recoverable** by an RW-faithful reader.

## Variant C — hidden TexDictionary wrapper (`lodveg.txd`, gostown)

A TXD-only lock that does **not** bloat sizes: the outer **TexDictionary (`0x16`) header is gone** — the
entry's first ~2 KB are zeroed and the chunk stream is obfuscated, so **no readable `0x16` exists anywhere**
(even Magic.TXD rejects it: _"unknown RenderWare stream block"_). But the inner **`TEXTURE_NATIVE` (`0x15`)
chunks are intact** — verified by byte-scanning `gostown6.img`'s `lodveg.txd`: 6 real textures
(`Gp_Grandpalm1/2`, `Gp_Grospalm1`, `Gp_petitpalm1`, `Gp_Grandfeuillu2`, `boardside`), readable names,
power-of-two dims, DXT3 + mips. The game renders them because RW's reader skips the unknown leading blocks
and reads the texture-natives; a parser that requires the `0x16` wrapper at the start fails.

**Recovered:** when `parseTxd` finds no usable TexDictionary, `recoverLockedTextures` **byte-scans** the
stream for `TEXTURE_NATIVE` chunks (type `0x15` + a `STRUCT` child + a plausible RW stream version
`…FFFF`) and parses each (the inner chunks keep intact sizes, so they parse normally). Hits are
sanity-checked (printable name + power-of-two dimensions) to avoid false matches in raster bytes, and
deduped by name. Triggers only when there's no `0x16` (or it yields nothing) → well-formed TXDs are
untouched. Covered by `tests/custom/txd/lodveg.txd` + a test in `txd.test.ts`. Recovery is at **load time**
(the locked bytes are packed as-is; the runtime parser reconstructs the dictionary), so no rebuild needed.

## Variant D — every container size bloated (`walton.dff`)

The most aggressive lock seen: it combines A + B and bloats **every container chunk's size**. Byte-probed:
the clump **Struct** declares `0x2798000C` (640 MB, = Variant B); the very first sibling **FrameList**
declares `0x48A81B0D` (→ 1.2 GB, overruns EOF); the **GeometryList** size swallows the 43 Atomics that follow
it; and **versions are scrambled** (`0x1803` kept, low 16 randomized vs `0x1803FFFF`). But the **honest signal
survives**: struct payload **counts** (`numAtomics = 43`, FrameList `numFrames = 77`) and all **leaf / child
sizes** are intact (the FrameList's inner Struct is exactly `4 + 77*56`; the 43 geometries have sane vert/tri
counts). So the data is fully recoverable **by count**, not by byte-scanning (a naive type-scan false-matches
`0x1A`/`0x0F`/`0x14` inside vertex/raster bytes — one probe "found" a 69 894-geometry list).

Without recovery, `parseDff` overruns on the first sibling (FrameList) and throws before ever reaching the
list-level Variant-A recovery; `recoverLockedAtomics`'s scan can't help either (`findChunkFrom` advances by the
bloated clump-Struct / FrameList sizes and bails). The version scramble turned out **not** to matter — version
is never a parse gate, so structural recovery alone suffices.

**Recovered:** `forEachClumpChild` detects the lock by the same bloated leading Struct (Variant B signature) and,
on a locked clump, recomputes **every** child's real end from its honest-sized children — `contentEnd` over a
per-container `CLUMP_CHILD_CONTENT` map (FrameList → `{Struct, Extension}`; GeometryList → `{Struct, Geometry}`;
Atomic → `{Struct, Extension}` with `stopAfter Extension` so the last Atomic doesn't swallow the trailing
clump-level Extension that holds the COL; clump Extension → `{Collision, Struct}`). Each child's parse then stays
bounded and the sibling walk lands on the next real chunk, so the geometry/atomic list parsers (and their own
A-recovery) take over. Valid clumps never trigger it (the leading Struct ends within the clump). Covered by
`tests/custom/locked-models/walton.dff` + tests in `dff.test.ts` (77 frames / 43 geometries / 43 atomics + COL).

## Fix (2026-06-19)

`parseDff` and `parseDffCollision` now iterate the clump via **`forEachClumpChild`** (in
`parsers/binary/chunks.ts`) instead of the size-trusting `forEachChild`. When the leading Struct's
declared size overshoots the clump end (impossible for a valid file), it uses the canonical **12-byte**
SA clump-struct payload and resumes sibling iteration right after it — recovering the FrameList,
GeometryList, all 57 atomics and the Extension (with COL3). Valid clumps are untouched (their Struct
ends within the clump, so the recovery branch never fires) → near-zero regression surface. Covered by a
committed custom fixture `tests/custom/locked-models/cheetah.dff` + tests in `dff.test.ts`.

For **Variant A**, `parseGeometryList`, `parseDff` and `parseTxd` add a count-based recovery via the shared
`recoverLockedList` (in `parsers/binary/chunks.ts`): after the normal boundary walk, if the declared
geometry / atomic / texture count is higher, they re-read the list RW-style with `findChunkFrom` (scan for
the next item past the bloated sizes + `0x0` padding) and `contentEnd` (advance by the item's real
children: struct + [matlist] + extension). Only runs on the mismatch → well-formed files are unaffected.
Covered by `tests/custom/locked-models/yosemite.dff` (31 atomics / 31 geometries) and the committed
`tests/custom/txd/yosemite.txd` (20 textures incl. `F350_mix`).

## What is fixed vs. what remains

- **Fixed — spawn no longer crashes (`physics-world.ts`).** Previously a locked/no-COL vehicle reached
  the chassis fallback with empty vertices; `ColliderDesc.convexHull(empty)` returns a **non-null but
  invalid** desc, so the `?? boxHull` guard never fired and `createCollider` threw _"expected instance
  of OA"_. `addConvexChassis` now only attempts the hull with enough points, wraps it in try/catch, and
  box-falls-back to the car's `halfExtents` (default `[1.2, 2.5, 0.7]`). This is a general robustness
  win for **any** vehicle with no usable COL, not just locked ones. Tests in `physics-world.test.ts`.
- **Fixed — Variant B renders (`forEachClumpChild`).** `cheetah.dff` now parses fully (83 frames / 57
  atomics / 57 geometries) with its embedded COL — see the fix section above.
- **Fixed — Variant A renders (count-based recovery).** `yosemite.dff` now recovers all 31 atomics / 31
  geometries; `buildVehicle` produces the full truck (4 wheels, doors, panels).
- **Fixed — Variant C textures recover (`recoverLockedTextures`).** gostown's `lodveg.txd` (no `0x16`
  wrapper) now yields its 6 LOD-vegetation textures via the byte-scan fallback, so the LOD ensembles render
  textured instead of flat grey.
- **Fixed — Variant D parses (`forEachClumpChild` content-walk).** `walton.dff` (every container size
  bloated) now recovers 77 frames / 43 geometries / 43 atomics + the embedded COL — see the Variant D
  section above.
- **Remains — byte-editing tools don't recover locks yet.** The engine `parseDff` / `parseDffCollision`
  handle all four variants, so in-game loading is fine. But the offline byte-editing tools (vehicle-optimizer
  scale / copy-effects, via **map-optimizer's** own size-trusting `readRw` in `codec/chunk.ts`) re-serialize
  raw chunks and still trust declared sizes — `readRw(walton)` finds **0 geometries**, so using a locked DFF
  as a `--prototype`/target there fails. To support that, add an `unlockDff(bytes)` that re-serializes clean
  headers (honest sizes) using the same recovery, so the generic codec reads a locked DFF as a standard one.
  Lower priority than in-game loading; not needed for clean Rockstar/most mod assets.

## Reproduce

- **Variant A** — `yosemite.dff`: the clump declares 31 atomics / 31 geometries; a boundary walk finds
  8 / 16 (atomics index up to 27), but reading each list by count with `RwStreamFindChunk`-style scanning
  (skip `0x0` padding, advance by each item's real struct/matlist/extension) recovers all 31.
- **Variant B** — `cheetah.dff`: read the clump's first child header — the Struct (`0x01`) declares size
  `16777228` while its real payload is 12 bytes; without `forEachClumpChild` `parseDff` returns an empty
  model and `parseDffCollision` returns `null` even though a `COL3` chunk is present near EOF.
