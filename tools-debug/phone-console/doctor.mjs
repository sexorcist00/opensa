/**

 *
 * This is the half of the panel that pays for itself. On a phone the answer to "nothing opened" lives at the
 * bottom of a log in a terminal with no scrollback worth the name, and the causes repeat: a pull brought
 * dependencies the tree does not have, `tsx` is missing, the game files are not where the convert looks, a
 * port is still held by the last run, `GAME` and `OUT` resolve to the same folder (2026-08-09: the convert
 * ate the archives it was reading), or shared storage is full while internal storage is not.
 *
 * Every check is a pure decision over an injected probe, so the interesting half is tested without a device.
