/**
 * The phone as a TOOL: MCP over the panel (plan 002 beside this file).
 *
 * The loop this replaces is the expensive one. An agent writes code in a container, the phone runs it, and
 * everything in between — did the convert start, what did preflight refuse, what did the capture say — is a
 * person reading a screen and typing it back. Every round trip costs a message and loses the detail nobody
 * thought to copy.
 *
 * So the panel's own capabilities become MCP tools. **It is a CLIENT of the running panel, never a second
 * copy of it**, and that is the load-bearing decision: `JobRunner` allows one job at a time, and two runners
 * on one phone is two converts fighting over the same folder. If the panel is not up, every tool here says
 * so instead of starting anything.
 *
 * **What it can do is exactly what the panel's buttons can do**, and that is deliberate. The jobs are an
 * allowlist (`jobs.mjs`), not a shell: `pull`, `setup`, the three converts, the share build, the tile bake's
 * link, the capture inbox and `commit & push`. An `exec` tool exists for the case the allowlist cannot cover
 * and is **off unless `PANEL_MCP_EXEC=1`** — a remote shell on somebody's phone is a thing they turn on
 * deliberately, never a default that arrives with an update.
 *
 * Two transports, one handler:
 *
 * - **stdio** (default) — for a Claude running ON the phone. Nothing is exposed to any network.
 * - **`--http [--port N]`** — JSON-RPC over POST, for a Claude that is somewhere else. It binds `127.0.0.1`
 *   like the panel, so reaching it from off-device is a tunnel the operator sets up on purpose, and it
 *   REQUIRES a bearer token (`PANEL_MCP_TOKEN`, or one generated and printed at startup). A tunnel plus no
 *   token is a shell on the open internet.
 *
 *   node tools-debug/phone-console/mcp.mjs            # stdio
 *   node tools-debug/phone-console/mcp.mjs --http     # POST http://127.0.0.1:8788/mcp
 *
 * The version negotiation, the discovery answer and the framing that survives a malformed byte live in
 * `mcp-protocol.mjs`, because the bridge needs the same answers and neither end owns them.
