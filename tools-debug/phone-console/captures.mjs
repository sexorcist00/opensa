/**
 * The way a measurement leaves the phone: filed into the repository, not read off a screen.
 *
 * `CLAUDE.md`'s standing rule is that every measured number is committed to `docs/benchmarks/` BEFORE it is
 * analysed, and the phone is where that rule is hardest to keep — the capture is a JSON blob behind a copy
 * button on a device with no editor worth the name, so it reaches the next session as a chat paste with its
 * conditions missing, or it does not reach it at all.
 *
 * So the panel takes the blob, writes the file the family's format asks for, stamps the conditions it can
 * PROVE (device, pak recipe, commit) into the note rather than trusting them to memory, and commits it.
 *
 * Two things it will not do, both deliberate:
 *
 * - **it never commits code.** Only the paths it just wrote are staged, and the commit names those paths, so
 *   a dirty worktree on a phone cannot be swept into a data commit;
 * - **it refuses a capture with no note.** A row nobody can place is a row nobody can compare, which the
 *   benchmark readme says in its first paragraph.
