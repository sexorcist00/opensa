# 002 — Chunked LOD generation with texture atlases

> **Decimation superseded (~2026-07-02):** the per-cell QEM decimation described below was **removed** — it degraded
> the models (holes/spikes). Cells are now baked **verbatim** (merged HD geometry, no simplification) through the
> shared `@opensa/lod-common` core; the modifier chain is where future simplification goes. See
> `tools/lod-common/docs/plans/002-shared-hd-to-lod-core.md` and the `opensa-lod-generator-decimation` memory. The
> chunking / atlas / strip / emit design below still stands; only the decimation step is gone.

**Status: 📝 Proposed (design).** Replace SA's per-instance LODs with **regenerated, grid-chunked** LODs baked
from the HD models: cut the world into equal square cells, and for each cell emit **one decimated merged mesh +
one atlas texture**. Strip the old LOD models, and emit fresh IPL placing the new cell-LODs. The modern
open-world LOD scheme (cf. GTA V SLOD). **The engine already renders this** (its streaming is a per-cell HD/LOD
grid), so this is **entirely a opensa-lod-generator task** — no `../src` render change, only a cell-size config match.

**Target: OpenSA only (decided 2026-06-29).** Originally dual-target (OpenSA + original SA), but the original-game
path was dropped: stock SA crashes on the cell-LODs (no-collision stock LODs, then per-model material/texture +
size limits the streamer can't take) and the fixes cost too much coverage for no OpenSA benefit — see the
`opensa-lod-generator-decimation` memory for the full real-SA diagnosis if it's ever revisited. Output is still standard
RenderWare DFF/TXD + text IDE/IPL (loads in stock SA), just not budgeted for SA's streamer. The dual-target
sections below are kept for that history.

## Goal (from the request)

1. **Remove all old LODs** — SA's `lod*` DFFs + their IPL `lod` references.
2. **Regenerate new LODs** from the HD models (decimation, not hand-authoring).
3. **Emit IPL** that places the new LODs.
4. **Chunk the map into equal squares**, each with **one big atlas texture** per square.

## Why chunked-atlas (and not per-model decimation)

Per-model decimation (one LOD per HD model) is simpler but keeps hundreds of small LOD draws + their textures.
The chunked scheme bakes a whole cell into **one mesh + one texture** → far fewer draw calls and texture binds
at distance, a clean uniform LOD ring, and LOD shading that matches HD (re-derive normals via map-optimizer's
plan 015, sample prelit from HD). The right architecture for a streamed open world.

## The scheme

```
world → grid of N×N-unit cells   (= the engine's streaming cellSize)
  per cell:
    gather HD instances whose origin falls in the cell      (resolveCells — Phase 0, done)
    merge their world-space geometry, grouped by texture
    decimate the merged mesh (QEM) to a far-view budget
    pack the cell's textures into ONE atlas; remap UVs to atlas sub-rects
    re-derive smooth-group normals (map-optimizer plan 015); bake prelit from HD
    emit  lod_<cx>_<cy>.dff   +   lod_<cx>_<cy>.txd (atlas)
  emit IPL inst entries placing each cell-LOD
  strip old lod* models + old lod references
```

## Pipeline (phased to de-risk — the atlas is the hard part, so it comes last)

- **Phase 0 — measure / assemble. ✅ Done** (`adapters/gta-sa/resolve.ts` + CLI): bucket exterior HD instances
  into the grid; report cells / instances / unique models / max-per-cell. On `original` @ 256 m: **520 cells,
  30 981 HD instances, 5 958 models, ≤ 422 instances/cell** — the numbers to pick cell size + budgets from.
- **Phase 1 — geometry LOD, no atlas yet.** Per cell: merge + **QEM decimate** (Garland–Heckbert edge-collapse),
  keeping the **original textures / multi-material** (no atlas). Emit cell DFF + IPL. Validate it loads, places,
  and the engine renders it. Proves assembly + decimation + placement before the atlas.
  - **1a — merge. ✅ Done** (`adapters/gta-sa/{io,model-source,merge}.ts`): load HD DFFs from the archives
    (engine `parseDff`, cached), transform each instance into cell-centre-relative native Z-up world space (IPL
    quaternion **conjugated**, DFF frame ignored for `objs` clumps — as the engine does for map atomics; an IDE `anim`
    def's atomics ARE placed by their frame hierarchy since plan 008, as the engine's weld does), bucket triangles by
    texture into a `MergedMesh`. Densest cell (3,−7): 422 instances → 85 959 verts / 56 490 tris / 156 textures
    in 24 ms. Unit tests on synthetic clumps (transform, re-base, texture grouping).
  - **1b — normals. ✅ Done** (`adapters/gta-sa/normals.ts`): re-derive smooth-group normals on the merged cell
    mesh via the shared `tool-kit/mesh/smooth-normals` core (extracted from map-optimizer plan 015 — now used by
    both tools). Densest cell: 85 959 → 102 053 verts (+16 k splits at hard edges), **all unit-length**, tris
    unchanged. Runs post-decimate once that lands. (Shared `tool-kit` also now holds the editable **IMG** module
    — open/add-replace/delete/rebuild — used by map-optimizer + opensa-lod-generator emit. Monorepo-package move:
    `docs/ideas/monorepo-packages.md`.)
  - **1c — QEM decimate. ✅ Done** (`tool-kit/mesh/simplify.ts` + `@opensa/sa-lod/decimate.ts`):
    Garland–Heckbert edge-collapse on the **whole merged cell** (not per model — per-model over-thins small
    surfaces → holes) to `lodCellRatio` (0.2) of the cell's triangles, floored at `lodCellMinTris` (1000) so
    sparse terrain/mountain cells aren't over-thinned. **This tool now targets OpenSA only** (decided 2026-06-29):
    real-SA streaming caps (a triangle cap + a ≤80 texture/material cap) were added then **removed** because they
    cost coverage (90 %→~64 % in dense cells) for no OpenSA benefit — SA crashes on stream-in past ~a few dozen
    materials/textures per model (one cell-LOD = one SA model + TXD), but OpenSA has no such limit. Per-texture
    groups → face groups, so texture seams + the
    cell's open silhouette are pinned with a heavy boundary quadric; UV/colour (+ **night** colour) ride along as
    interpolated attributes; placement = cheapest of {endpoints, midpoint}; foldover collapses rejected. Two extra
    `simplify` guards keep the far view clean: an **edge-length cap** (`maxEdgeFactor` 1.5 — QEM slivers flat
    surfaces into long spikes, e.g. building edges grew 9→52 units) and a **per-group floor** (`minFacesPerGroup`
    2 — a flat surface otherwise collapses to nothing, vanishing its texture). Vertices are **not** welded —
    welding smears textures across UV seams and collapses stacked terrain. Pipeline is merge → decimate → normals.
    Coverage on the stock map: city ~90 %, mountain ~99 %, desert 70–98 %; ~1.65 M LOD triangles total. Unit
    tests: `simplify` (budget, bounds, edge cap, group floor) + `decimate` (budget, edge cap, group survival,
    night colour). **Open:** tiny flat decorative islands (sidewalk grass, forest-floor patches) still erode at
    the 20 % budget — flat collapses are free and the per-group floor only protects 2 faces for the whole texture;
    a per-component floor fixed it but 3–4× the triangles, so deferred for a targeted fix (see the
    `opensa-lod-generator-decimation` memory).
  - **1d — emit.** Split: - **1d-i — DFF writer. ✅ Done** (`@opensa/sa-lod/encode-dff.ts`): build a standard SA clump from scratch
    (FrameList + GeometryList + Atomic + per-texture MaterialList + **BinMesh PLG** so the real game renders
    the splits, + the **night-colour** plugin when present) via the map-optimizer chunk codec +
    `encodeGeometryStruct`. The cell-LOD bake emits geometry **two-sided** (`encodeLodDff(…, { doubleSided: true })`)
    — see [Two-sided geometry](#two-sided-geometry-opensa-cull-fix) for why + why it's opt-in. A mesh that exceeds
    the DFF **65 535-vertex u16 limit** is **split across multiple geometries/atomics** in the one clump
    (`splitMesh`), all sharing the identity frame. Round-trips through the engine `parseDff`. - **1d-ii — finalize. ✅ Done** (`adapters/gta-sa/finalize.ts`, CLI `--out <path>`): bake every cell → one
    `models/lods.img` (cell DFF + per-cell TXD each, plus one shared `lods.col` of **bounds-only COL3** models —
    one per cell, named to its model — so SA has collision to stream them; without it the game faults
    `MODEL_DOES_NOT_HAVE_COLLISION_LOADED`) via the tool-kit editable IMG, emit `data/maps/lods.ide` (cell-LOD defs,
    `lodDrawDistance` 1500) + `data/maps/lods.ipl` (inst at cell centre, lod = −1), register all three in
    `data/gta.dat` (decided), mirror the rest to `--out`. Cell-LOD ids start at **max IDE id + 1** (decided) —
    the count exceeds the stock ≤18630 model ceiling, so this build needs an extended ID limit (fastman92
    "model special features", 0–19999). Dual-target: `lod`-prefix name (OpenSA bucket) + IDE/IPL + big drawDist
    (original + Project2DFX). Validated in-memory: built IMG round-trips — `lod_3_-7` → 4000 tris / 81 textures,
    **81/81 covered by its cell TXD**. By default **additive** (old `lod*` coexist); `--strip-lods` removes them
    (1d-iii). Trees are excluded from the bake (handled by `lod-trees-generator`); procobj is never in the IPLs. - **1d-iii — strip old LODs. ✅ Done** (`adapters/gta-sa/strip.ts`, CLI `--strip-lods`): on the finished build,
    drop every stock-LOD instance from the text IPLs and the binary streams in `gta3.img` — repairing the shared
    text↔binary `lod`-index space via the proven `@opensa/map-placement/ipl-{text,binary}-strip` (moved out of
    `lod-trees-generator`) — and delete its `.dff`/`.txd` from `gta3.img`. **A model is a stock LOD only when it
    is both `lod*`-named AND actually referenced as a `lod` target** — the name alone is unreliable
    (`LODCJ_SLOT_BANK` is a real interior prop placed directly, never pointed to → kept; the crude `startsWith
'lod'` test wrongly stripped it and crashed loading `int_veg.ipl`). The **same** `isOldLod` predicate gates
    instance-removal _and_ DFF-deletion, so a deleted model can't have surviving instances (no dangling refs).
    The cell-LOD `lods.*` assets are skipped (they're `lod*`-named too); IDE defs left as-is. Verified on the
    stock map: 5803 instances + 4082 IMG entries removed, `int_veg`/`lods.*` untouched, archives re-parse.
    Remaining: verify DFF/TXD size vs the stream-model limit in-game.
- **Phase 2 — per-cell TXD (revised from "atlas").** Probing showed **88 % of a cell's texture groups tile**
  (UV > 1.5 — roads/pavement/terrain), so a true UV-remap atlas would smear the bulk. **Decision: per-cell TXD,
  not an atlas** — one TXD per cell holding the cell's textures (downscaled to `lodTextureSize`, default 64),
  geometry stays **multi-material with original UVs** → tiling is perfect, no remap. A true single-texture atlas
  (1 draw/cell, needs baked tiling via render-to-texture) is a later optimisation.
  - **2a — texture source. ✅ Done** (`adapters/gta-sa/texture-source.ts`): index every TXD in the archives
    (engine `parseTxd`), decode a texture's top mip to RGBA (map-optimizer `decodeDxt` / raw), cached. Densest
    cell: 156/156 textures resolved in ~380 ms.
  - **2b — cell TXD writer. ✅ Done** (shared `@opensa/sa-lod/encode-txd`): downscale (2× box, mip lib) →
    **DXT-compress** (DXT1 opaque / DXT5 alpha) + mip chain via `encodeDxtStruct` → TEXTURE_NATIVE →
    TEXTURE_DICTIONARY. Round-trips through the engine `parseTxd`. DXT shrank the full build's TXDs from ~324 MB
    raw to ~61 MB (`lods.img` 458 → 196 MB) — shared with `sa-procobj-placement`.
- **Phase 3 — integrate + remove old.** Strip the SA `lod*` models + their IPL entries, emit the new cell-LOD
  instances, set the bake cell size = the engine `cellSize`. Emits the **dual-target** build below (no engine
  code — see "Engine fit").
- **Phase 4 (optional) — procedural clutter.** Distant trees/rocks impostors (see "Procedural clutter" below).

## Dual-target binding (OpenSA + original SA) — one build

The bake is identical; only how each renderer _binds_ the cell-LOD differs. We emit **one build that satisfies
both**, with **no edits to the HD instances** (independent-LOD binding — chosen for simplicity + a clean blast
radius; the alternative, rewriting each HD inst's IPL `lod` index to point at its cell-LOD, was rejected as
invasive):

- **Name** each cell-LOD `lod_<cx>_<cy>` → **OpenSA** auto-buckets it into `cell.lod` by the `lod`-prefix and
  streams it on the LOD ring (no IDE/IPL `lod`-index needed).
- **IDE def + IPL `inst`** with a **large draw distance** → **original SA** renders it as an independent distant
  object; its draw distance (not a per-instance link) governs visibility, and HD↔LOD overlap is handled by the
  engine's normal alpha-fade. The IPL `inst` `lod` column stays `-1` (HD instances untouched).

**Original-SA prerequisites (not our code, but required for it to look right there):**

- **Project2DFX** — effectively required: vanilla caps draw distance (~300 m), too short for a 256 m cell-LOD to
  read at distance; Project2DFX lifts the cap so the cell-LODs show.
- **A limit adjuster** (fastman92 / Open Limit Adjuster) — for object/model/stream limits. Net object count
  actually **drops** (we remove thousands of per-instance `lod*`, add ~520 cell-LODs), but stay safe.
- **Stream model size** — one merged cell DFF must fit the streaming size limit; the decimation budget controls
  this (Phase 1 measures it).

## Engine fit — already chunked, no render-engine change needed

OpenSA's engine reimplemented LOD as a **cell grid**, which fits chunked-atlas LODs natively:

- `renderware/map/world-grid.ts` — `buildWorldGrid(defs, cellSize)` buckets the map into **square cells**,
  splitting each into **HD vs LOD** by `isLodModel` (the `lod`-prefix).
- `streaming.system.ts` — requests each cell at **HD _or_ LOD** detail by distance ring (`streamKey(cx, cy,
lod)`); never both → **no double-draw**, **no per-instance suppression** needed (the ring already does it).
- `build-cell.ts` — builds a cell's meshes from its HD or LOD instance list.

A generated `lod_<cx>_<cy>` model (lod-prefixed) is auto-bucketed into `cell.lod` and rendered as-is. **No
`../src` change** — only **config**: the bake cell size must equal the streaming `cellSize` (one baked LOD = one
engine cell), plus the LOD-ring distance (also config).

## Two-sided geometry (OpenSA cull fix)

**Problem.** OpenSA's renderer draws opaque world materials `FrontSide` (back-face-culled — `build-clump.ts`:
`side: transparent ? DoubleSide : FrontSide`). SA map geometry has **inconsistent triangle winding** and **mostly
no vertex normals** (measured: ~29 046 / 31 472 ground verts had zero normals), and a cell merges arbitrary HD
geometry, so a merged cell ends up with ~a third of its triangles facing away → culled → the ground reads as
shredded shards / holes from above.

**Why not the obvious fixes.** (a) _Make the engine render LODs `DoubleSide`_ — rejected: must not touch `../src`,
and the build must also load in the real game. (b) _Re-wind the geometry consistently (all outward)_ — there's no
robust outward reference for arbitrary merged concave geometry; a `force-up` heuristic only fixed flat ground, not
walls. (c) _Per-triangle normal-based winding_ — most source verts have no normals.

**Solution — emit it two-sided in the DFF** (`encode-dff.ts` `doubleSided`): write each triangle in **both**
windings (`a,b,c` **and** `a,c,b`). **Indices only — the vertex count is untouched**, so it doesn't push toward
the u16 split, and lighting is vertex-normal Gouraud (winding-independent). Whatever a surface's winding, one copy
always faces the camera; OpenSA's `FrontSide` cull keeps that one and drops the other. The real game doesn't cull
the world, so it draws both coincident copies (identical pixels — harmless). Generation-only, no engine change.

**Opt-in** (`EncodeLodDffOptions.doubleSided`, default **off**): the cell-LOD bake turns it on
(`finalize.ts`); the _other_ `encode-dff` reuser — `sa-procobj-placement`, a **real-game** target — leaves it
**off**, because a single authored impostor has consistent winding and renders fine single-sided, and doubling is
just an unproven structural change + wasted triangles for the real game. (`lod-trees-generator` has its own
billboard encoder and is unaffected.) Cost: ~2× the cell-LOD's triangle/index count — fine for OpenSA, and the
reason the cell-LOD tool is OpenSA-only anyway (the real game can't take the merged cells regardless; see the
`opensa-lod-generator-decimation` memory).

## Procedural clutter (procobj / trees / rocks)

Two distinct kinds, handled differently:

- **IPL-placed trees/rocks/objects** → **already included.** They're ordinary HD instances, so the per-cell merge
  bakes them like any other model. No special handling.
- **Procobj-scattered clutter** (`procobj.dat`, runtime-scattered by surface material — `grass / flowers /
bushes / cacti / rocks / trees / underwater`) → **not in IPL**, so not in the bake by default:
  - **Small clutter** (grass/flowers/bushes/cacti, draw dist 50–100 m) → **skip.** Invisible at LOD distance and
    runtime-scattered; baking it is pointless.
  - **Procobj trees (≈150 m) and rocks** → worth baking as **distant impostors** (Phase 4) to kill far-forest
    **pop-in**. Requires replicating the engine's **deterministic** procobj scatter offline (reuse
    `procobj-runtime`/`procobj-scatter` read-only so the baked far forest matches the near one), then adding
    **tree billboards** / low-poly rocks into the cell mesh + atlas. Real but standard; kept optional.

## Reuse vs. new

- **Reuse (engine `../src`, read-only):** IDE/IPL parsers + world transforms (already in `resolveCells`); the
  engine's cell grid + HD/LOD streaming (renders the cell-LODs as-is); for Phase 4, the procobj scatter.
- **Reuse (sibling `../map-optimizer`):** the **DXT encoder + VER2 archive writer** (its plans 010/011) for the
  atlas TXD + packing; **smooth-group normals** (its plan 015) for the decimated cells; the DFF serializer.
- **New (in opensa-lod-generator):** **QEM decimator** (attribute-aware — preserve material/UV-seam boundaries, weight
  silhouette/border edges so the far contour survives); **rectangle-pack atlas builder** + UV remap; **prelit
  re-bake** onto the decimated mesh (barycentric sample from HD); an **IPL writer** (text `inst` — trivial); the
  **bake driver** + `finalize` (currently stubbed in the gta-sa adapter).

## Hard problems / risks

- **Atlas + tiled textures (dominant risk).** Terrain/road textures tile (UV > 1). Atlas packing breaks tiling.
  Options: (a) **bake** the tiled result to a unique texture (flattens tiling, costs memory); (b)
  **render-to-texture the cell** from the LOD view (closest to AAA distant LOD); (c) accept a non-tiled crop
  (fine at distance). Likely a mix: bake tiled ground, atlas the rest.
- **Cell-size alignment** — bake cell size must equal the engine `cellSize`, else a LOD spans cells and loads
  partially. Config, not code.
- **World assembly** — global IPL→world (done in Phase 0, read-only).
- **Decimation across merged materials** — QEM must treat material/atlas-region + open borders as constraints,
  else it holes/smears the silhouette.
- **Cell seams** — adjacent cell-LODs may gap/overlap at borders; snap shared border verts or overlap slightly.
- **Memory** — one atlas per cell × many cells. Budget atlas size (512²/1024²) + cell size together (Phase 0
  numbers).
- **Placement is NOT affected** (unlike a terrain remaster): LODs are display-only — no object/path/spawn
  re-authoring, no collision. This is why LOD generation is tractable.
- **Verification** — in-game only: HD↔LOD popping, atlas seams, tiling artifacts, cell gaps, forest pop-in.

## Scope

- **In:** assemble HD → cells (done); per-cell merge + QEM decimate; texture atlas + UV remap; prelit re-bake +
  smooth-group normals; emit cell DFF/TXD + **IDE + IPL** for the **dual-target** build (OpenSA `lod`-prefix +
  original-SA independent high-draw-distance objects, HD instances untouched); strip old LODs; align cell size;
  (optional) procobj tree/rock impostors.
- **Out:** per-instance (1:1) LODs; single-quad **building billboards** (a separate render-to-texture technique);
  collision (LODs have none); HD geometry changes (map-optimizer's domain); small procobj clutter.

## Relationship to other plans

- **opensa-lod-generator 001** — the architecture this implements (`LodAdapter.bakeCell` / `finalize`).
- **map-optimizer 015 / 010 / 011** — reused for normals + the atlas TXD / archive writers.
- **map-optimizer 014** (terrain smoothing — shelved): independent. Chunked LODs _reduce_ detail and so sidestep
  every reason 014 failed (no curvature recovery, no relaxation, no substrate move).
