/**
 * Install the added cars INTO a built `sa` tree, in place — the part of an added car that is simply a
 * replacement car once it has an id (plan 002).
 *
 * The whole of "install a car" is `vehicle-installer`'s `applyVehicle`, called with the allocated id: the
 * dff/txd into the vehicles archive family, the four data rows merged, `features.txt` declared, `cleo/`
 * carried, and — since plans 012/013 — its ModelVariations section, `.fxt`, audio row and parked spot.
 * Nothing of that is re-implemented here. What IS this tool's is the id: where it comes from, that it never
 * moves, and that the tree still agrees with the ledger afterwards.
 *
 * The tree is edited IN PLACE, like `--rebake --kind sa`, because an added car is added to a build that
 * already exists — there is no source game to copy from and no output to wipe.
 *
 * **The models go LOOSE into `modloader/added-vehicles/`, not into an archive** — see `loose-files.ts` for
 * the ceiling that decided it (the game registers 8 IMG archives and the built tree already spends six).
