/**
 * Which ADDED cars a run installs, and whether the tree can say what each of them is a variation OF.
 *
 * The source root is `mods-src/<game>/add-vehicles` and it is read through the ONE vehicles resolver
 * (`@opensa/tool-kit/vehicles-dir`), the same call `vehicle-installer`, `vehicle-cutscene` and `cars-server`
 * make — so the added fleet is planned by the same rules as the replacement fleet: flat or `models/`+`new/`,
 * `screenshots/` and `reserved/` never scanned, one folder per slot, a stray folder refused.
 *
 * Two things are this root's own, and both are refusals rather than defaults:
 *
 * 1. **It is SA-only.** The feature is ModelVariations + FLA + CLEO; our own engine has none of them. A
 *    layered root whose applied layers include `common` or `opensa` is refused, because a `common/` added
 *    car would silently be planned into an `opensa` build that cannot use it.
 * 2. **Every `(base)` must name a car the built tree really has.** A mistyped base is not a broken build —
 *    it is a car that quietly never enters traffic, never inherits a sound and has no parts to re-model.
