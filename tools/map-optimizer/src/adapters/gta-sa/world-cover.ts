/**
 * "Is something standing on this face?" — the geometry half of world visibility (plan 025, branch
 * `025-world-visibility`).
 *
 * Five model-local criteria failed to separate a texel-smear DEFECT from an authoring device, and the field
 * said why: `road03sfn`, `backalleys1_sfe` and `garse_85_sfe` all carry large stretched faces that nobody can
 * see, because they are skirts with the NEIGHBOURING BUILDINGS STANDING ON THEM. Visibility is a property of
 * the assembled world, so the judgement has to be made with the placements in hand — which is what plan 019's
 * world pre-pass already walks.
 *
 * **What this is and is not.** A placement is reduced to its world AABB, and a point counts as covered when
 * another model's box encloses the space just above it. That is deliberately crude, and the `reach` is what
 * keeps it honest. A box is also the outer hull, so a hollow archway reads as solid — this OVER-covers, and
 * every threshold below is therefore set to err the other way.
 *
 * **`reach` is measured, not guessed** (2026-08-11). Dumping the 30 faces `road03sfn` still carried at
 * `reach = 2` showed every one of them covered at 5–10 units, not 2: the deck resting over that skirt clears
 * it by more than a metre. At 5 the ranking stops contradicting the field labels (no CLEAN model outranks a
 * BROKEN one); at 10 `road03sfn` leaves the ranking outright, at the cost of hiding more. 5 is the default
 * because the smaller value that satisfies the labels is the one that hides least — the standing bias here.
