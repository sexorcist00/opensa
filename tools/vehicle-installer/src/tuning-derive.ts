/**
 * An added car's TUNING PARTS, derived — plan 005.
 *
 * A car that varies a stock slot usually re-models that slot's mod-shop parts to fit its own body, and ships
 * them under the STOCK names (`wg_r_lr_rem1.dff` inside `059veh - … (remingtn)`). Those names must never
 * reach the archive: they would replace the part every OTHER car using it wears. So each shipped part gets a
 * new unique name, and everything the game knows about the stock one is cloned under it — the IDE row, the
 * shop item, the price, the `link` to its mirror, and its place on the car's `carmods.dat` line.
 *
 * **Nothing here is a table.** The user's earlier tool carried a hand-written rename per car; every value
 * below is read from the built `data/` or from the name itself, so a car nobody has seen yet works the same.
 *
 * **The new name is the stock name plus `_<token>`.** Not a rewrite of the stock naming scheme: SA derives a
 * component's flags from the name's PREFIX (`CAtomicModelInfo::SetupVehicleUpgradeFlags`), and the exact set
 * of prefixes it switches on is documented but not exhaustively known here — appending keeps every prefix
 * rule matching whatever it is, where replacing a field in the middle would be a guess. The ceiling is 19
 * characters (`docs/gta-sa-original/carmods-upgrade-ceilings.md`) and it is REFUSED, not truncated.
 *
 * The token is `slotTokens`' — the shortest prefix that tells the slot apart from every other slot, floor 3
 * — and not the slot name itself, because the whole name overflows the ceiling on real data
 * (`wg_r_lr_slv1_slamvan` is 20, so today's scheme refuses a part the shop needs). It is derived, not
 * registered: the same slot table always yields the same token.
 *
 * **A part is base-specific when its IDE row's TXD column names the base car**, and generic when it names
 * `vehicle` (nitro, hydraulics, stereo, wheels — 48 of the stock rows). That is the rule that decides what
 * a derived `mods` line keeps: generic parts stay, re-modelled parts take their new name, and a
 * base-specific part the car does NOT ship is dropped — it fits the base's body, not this one.
