/**
 * REBAKE — re-run the vehicle half of the pipeline against a game that is already BUILT (plan 006).
 *
 * The install path builds a whole game dir from a stock tree; the converter then bakes every asset class in
 * it. That is minutes of work, and a vehicle round changes a handling row, a model, or one shader-visible
 * detail of one car. This does the vehicle part alone, IN PLACE:
 *
 *   1. each mod's `*.settings.txt` merges into the BUILT `data/*` — the same replace-by-model merge the
 *      install uses, so running it twice changes nothing the first run did not already do;
 *   2. its `features.txt` declaration is merged into `data/vehicle-features.txt`, per model, so rebaking ONE
 *      car cannot drop what the others declared;
 *   3. its `.dff` + `.txd` are converted to the model's `.osm` — the same `buildVehicleOsm` opensa-pack
 *      calls — and that entry is REPLACED in whichever `models/*.img` already holds it.
 *
 * Nothing else in the tree is touched: no map, no peds, no wipe, no copy.
 *
 * It can also ADD a car the built game never had, because nothing about a car is baked into the pak: the
 * roster is the TEXT `data/vehicles.ide` the runtime parses at boot, and a spawn resolves `<model>.osm` out
 * of the archive BY NAME (`gta-sa-world.adapter.ts`; the pak manifest carries cells, textures and water, and
 * no vehicle table at all). What an addition needs is therefore only what a mod already ships — an ide row
 * with an id — and what it must not do is take an id another model owns, which is checked before anything is
 * written. A car added this way has no traffic or parked presence until a full build writes the placements,
 * and the report says so rather than letting it read as a failure.
