# 009 — New tuning parts, the carmods guard, and shared part names

**Status: ✅ Implemented 2026-08-17.** Opened by a boot crash of the reference bottle after the session's
first FULL delivery of a built `data/` (plan 008's field note): `0x4C4576`, `CAtomicModelInfo::
SetupVehicleUpgradeFlags` on a NULL model info — `carmods.dat` named a part no IDE row defined
(`docs/gta-sa-original/carmods-unknown-part-crash.md`).

## What was wrong

`blade - 1964 Ford Thunderbird - gross` ships two parts the game never had (`spl_b_lr_bl.dff`,
`bnt_b_lr_bl.dff`), names them on its carmods line, and carries their IDE rows + shop entries in a
`tuning_new_parts.txt` the installer did not read. The line merged, the rows did not, and the real game
dereferences the lookup without a check. OpenSA never noticed (it does not execute carmods yet), and the
bottle's `data/` had not been re-delivered since 10 Aug, so the built line had never been booted.

## What ships

1. **`tuning_new_parts.txt` is read** (`tuning-parts.ts`, called from `applyVehicle` BEFORE the settings
   merge): bare IDE rows → `data/maps/veh_mods/veh_mods.ide` `objs` (replace by NAME, an id another model owns
   is refused with a warning naming the owner); `shops.<section>|<anchor>` and `prices.<section>|<anchor>`
   blocks → `data/shopping.dat`, inserted after the anchor line inside the nested section (depth-tracked, so
   the same anchor in another section is not taken; missing anchor → appended at the section end + warning;
   missing section → warning, nothing written). Idempotent by name. Format in `docs/contracts/vehicles.md`.
2. **`assertCarmodsModels`** — after every install and both rebake kinds: every `link`/`mods`/`wheel` token
   must resolve to an IDE row somewhere under `data/` (the game's own lookup is by name across every loaded
   IDE); a miss FAILS the run naming the line and the token. Skipped on a tree without `veh_mods.ide` (a
   data fixture, not a bootable game — every token would fail for the wrong reason).
3. **Shared part names are warned about** (`sharedVehicleFiles`, install + both rebakes). Found while
   verifying: the voodoo ships its own `rbmp_lr_bl1.dff` in the blade's part slot; the archive holds one
   entry per name, the folder later in install order wins, and a `--rebake --only blade` had silently put
   the blade's bumper on the voodoo (the family shrank 595 968 B — that is how it was noticed). Install
   warns per shared name with every owner; a rebake of either car warns that it is overriding, and which
   folder a full install would let win. Not refused — the mod set has always shipped this way.

## Measured

- `build/original/sa` before: `carmods.dat` line 39 (`blade`) → 2 tokens with no IDE row of 15 172 names.
  After `--rebake original --kind sa --only blade`: `veh_mods.ide` +2 rows (1194, 1195), `shopping.dat`
  +2 items in `shops/carmod2` after `exh_lr_bl2`, +2 prices in `prices/CarMods` after `exh_lr_bl2`, guard
  green (15 174 names, 0 misses). Same census on the bottle after the sync: 0 misses.
- Suite: vehicle-installer 106/106 (`tuning-parts.test.ts` 11, `img-merge.test.ts` +3), tsc + eslint clean.
- Field verdict, 2026-08-17: the bottle boots, the `new/` cabbie (Checker Taxicab) is the one on the road — plan 007's `new/` layer confirmed in a REAL run for the first time, and plan 008's rebake path with it.

## What it does not do

- It does not invent an IDE id for a part (a mod that names a new part without its row still fails — that
  is the point).
- It does not resolve the shared-part conflict; it names it. Two cars that genuinely need different geometry
  under one part name need one of them renamed by its author, and its carmods line with it.
