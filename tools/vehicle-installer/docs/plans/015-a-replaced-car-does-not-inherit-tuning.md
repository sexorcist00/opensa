# 015 — A replaced car does not inherit the stock car's tuning

**Status: step 1 BUILT 2026-08-22 (the user's call, from a field crash he diagnosed himself); step 2 open.**

## The defect

`carmods.dat`'s `mods` line says which upgrade parts a car ACCEPTS. When a mod replaces a stock car and its
`*.settings.txt` carries no `carmods` line of its own, the installer leaves the stock line in place — so the
mod's model is offered the stock car's whole tuning kit, **a kit it was never adapted for**.

That is not a taste question. A universal (`*_b_*`) Transfender part hangs on a `ug_*` dummy inside the car
model — `ug_bonnet` for the hood scoops, `ug_spoiler`, `ug_roof`, `ug_wing_left/right`, `ug_lights`,
`ug_nitro` — and most mod authors do not carry those dummies over. Installing a part whose dummy is absent
crashes the real game at **`0x007F0BF7`**, *"frame did not find the child"*, reading `+0x98` off a null frame.

**Field, 2026-08-22**: the crash reproduced twice while flying a helicopter over the city, and stopped the
moment `ModelVariations` was removed — the plugin spawns traffic already tuned, so it is what mounts the
parts. The two crash dumps carry the upgrade id on the stack: `0x3F4` = **1012 `bnt_b_sc_p_l`** and `0x3ED` =
**1005 `bnt_b_sc_l`** — hood scoops, on `willard` and `greenwoo`.

## What the data says

Derived from stock (`scripts/debug/` census, 2026-08-22):

| | |
| --- | ---: |
| stock cars offering a part their model cannot mount | **0 of 77** |
| our built tree | **30 of 154** |
| of those 30, cars that INHERIT the stock line | **4** — `willard`, `greenwoo`, `stallion`, `admiral` |
| of those 30, cars that declare their own line and still name an unmountable part | 26 (all of them nitro) |
| `vehicles` cars declaring their own carmods line | 82 of 212 (130 inherit) |
| `add-vehicles` cars declaring one | 65 of 115 |
| inheriting cars that ship part `.dff`s of their own | **0** |

The three cars that crashed are three of the four inheritors. The mount table itself is read off stock data:
every one of the 17 stock cars offered `bnt_b_*` carries `ug_bonnet`, all 31 with `spl_b_*` carry
`ug_spoiler`, all 77 with `nto_b_*` carry `ug_nitro`, and so on — no exceptions in either direction.

## Step 1 — no declared line, no inherited line

**A `vehicles/` car whose settings declare no `carmods` line has the stock line for its slot REMOVED.** The
car simply is not tunable, which is the honest reading of a mod that says nothing about tuning: the stock line
describes a model that is no longer in the slot.

Not a widening of scope: measured above, **no inheriting car ships part `.dff`s**, so nothing that would have
been buyable stops being buyable. An added car has no stock line for its own id, so the rule is a no-op there.

Done when: `removeCarmods` exists and is idempotent, `applyVehicle` calls it in the else-branch of the
carmods merge, and the built tree's four inheritors lose their lines.

**BUILT.** `removeCarmods` in `merge.ts` (the private `removeFromSection` it reuses already existed for the
carcols move), called from `mergeSettings`, which now takes the slot. 254 tests in the tool green.

**The footprint, measured on the fleet before the next build**: exactly **7 lines are removed** —
`admiral`, `greenwoo`, `moonbeam`, `romero`, `savanna`, `stallion`, `willard`. The other 123 inheriting cars
have no stock line to lose. Four of the seven are the flagged ones (three of them the crashers); the other
three — `moonbeam`, `romero`, `savanna` — carry the mounts their stock line needs, so they lose tuning that
would have WORKED. That is the price of the coarse rule and it is the user's call: a car that says nothing
about tuning is treated as not tunable. Step 2's mount check is the finer instrument if he ever wants those
three back.

## Step 2 — a line may not name a part the model cannot mount

The 26 cars that DO declare a line still name parts their model has no dummy for (nitro, every one of them —
an author copying the stock line). `ModelVariations` no longer offers those (`add-vehicles` dropped the
`nto_` family from tuned traffic the same day), but Transfender still would, and the crash would be the same.

The rule: when the installer writes a car's `mods` line, it drops the universal parts whose `ug_*` mount the
car's own model does not carry, and WARNS naming car and part — the same shape as the DXT-alignment warning
(plan 014's neighbour). Mount table above; car-specific families (`_lr_`, `_a_`, `_c_`) are out of scope
because they replace a standard component every model carries rather than hang on a `ug_` dummy.
