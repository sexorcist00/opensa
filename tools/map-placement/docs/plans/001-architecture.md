# 001 — map-placement: architecture & API

**Status: ✅ As-built (shared library).** `@opensa/map-placement` is a `type:tool` **library** (no CLI) holding the
SA map-edit workflows shared by the LOD tools: object-id allocation, IDE / `gta.dat` editing, swapped-HD retexture,
and procobj scatter conversion / stripping. It was extracted from `lod-trees-generator` (+ the procobj modules
recovered from git history and generalised) — see `lod-procobj-generator`
[001 §extraction, phases 2 & 4](../../../lod-procobj-generator/docs/plans/001-architecture.md).

## Why it exists

`lod-trees-generator` (impostors) and `lod-procobj-generator` (simplified copies) place their LODs the **same** way
— allocate ids, register IDE/`gta.dat`, edit IPLs, retxd swapped HD models, scatter procobj into static IPL — only
the LOD model they point at differs. That placement machinery lives here so both import it instead of duplicating
it. `tool-kit` stays format-agnostic; this package is the SA-specific **write** layer.

Layering: `@opensa/rw-codec` (bytes) → `@opensa/renderware` (read/parse) → **`map-placement`** (SA write
workflows) → the LOD tools (CLI). Sits beside `sa-lod` (mesh encode) under `tools/`.

## Public API (`exports`)

### `./ide` — id allocation + registration

- `allocateLodIds(models, used)` → `Map<model, id>` — the **lowest unused** ids in the stock space, ascending,
  gaps allowed, deterministic (models sorted). **Hard cap `id ≤ 18630`**: ids above it silently fail to load on
  stock SA (no limit adjuster) — the "HD swapped, no LOD shows" symptom. Do not widen the window.
- `lodAlias(name, index, prefix = 'lodt')` — the model name SA registers (IDE `objs` + `<model>.dff` IMG entry).
  Usually the LOD's own name; when it would overflow the IMG entry limit (≤ 19 chars), a short synthetic
  `<prefix><index>` (visuals unaffected — the DFF still names its real textures in the shared TXD).
- `buildLodIde(modelToId, txd, drawDistance)` → an IDE `objs` text (`id, model, txd, drawDistance, flags`, id-ordered,
  CRLF). Flags `0x200084` (alpha + draw-last + LOD-friendly).
- `patchGtaDat(dat, idePath)` — splice an `IDE` line into `gta.dat` (IDEs must load **before** the IPLs that
  instance the models).

### `./retxd` — swapped-HD retexture (coverage-gated)

- `retxdSwappedModels(gamePath, idePaths, dffPath, txdPath, models)` → `RetxdResult { ides, txds }` — when a
  swapped HD DFF references textures that live in the user's `--txd` (not the stock TXD its IDE names), pack the
  custom TXD **and** rewrite the model's IDE `txd` column to it.
- `selectTxd(refs, custom)` / `editIdeTxd(text, modelToTxd)` — the **coverage gate**: a model is repointed only to
  a custom TXD that actually contains its textures (the one covering the most, ≥ 1 hit). A model whose textures
  aren't in any `--txd` keeps its **stock** `txd` — repointing it would strip its textures in-game.
- `trimTxd(bytes, keep)` (`./txd-trim`) — before packing, each custom TXD is **trimmed to the union of texture
  names its repointed models reference**, dropping the unused `TEXTURE_NATIVE` chunks (kept ones copied **verbatim**
  — native format preserved, count fixed). A shared mod TXD often also holds textures for models we dropped
  (procobj / non-tree); only the repointed models read it, so trimming is lossless + safe. Falls back to the whole
  TXD on a locked/recovered/round-trip mismatch. (e.g. a 49 MB vegetation TXD → ~36 MB, 148 → 94 textures.)

### `./procobj-strip` — `procobj.dat` filter

- `stripProcObj(text, keep)` → `{ removed, text }` — drop every scatter rule whose object (column 2) fails `keep`;
  comments/headers/surface+spacing columns preserved.
- `UNDERWATER_PROCOBJ` — the never-touch set (seaweed/starfish/searock, surface `P_UNDERWATERBARREN`): **never
  stripped, never converted**, regardless of `keep`. Shared land debris (`p_rubble*`) is intentionally **not** here.

### `./procobj` (`convert.ts` + `world.ts`) — scatter → static IPL

- `convertProcObj(options)` → `null | { datLine, objects }` — convert `--dff ∩ procobj` species from runtime
  scatter into **static IPL instances**: reuse the engine's vanilla `scatterProcObjects`, thin it
  (`cullByMinDistance` MINDIST min-spacing + a global cap — static can't materialise full runtime density), emit
  each as an HD `inst` + its LOD `inst` (text-internal `lod` link), and strip those species from `procobj.dat`.
  Generalised: `ProcObjSpecies = { hdId, height, lodId, lodModel }` (not impostor-specific); the IPL name is an
  option. Returns the `gta.dat` IPL line to register.
- `cullByMinDistance(placements, minDist)` / `iplQuaternion(yaw)` — the thinning + the yaw→quat helper.
- `buildMapDefinitions(gamePath, archive)` (`world.ts`) — assemble the `MapDefinitions` (object catalog from the
  gta.dat IDEs + every instance from the text IPLs and the binary IPL streams in `gta3.img`) that the engine's
  collision / procobj-scatter code expects — the **offline** counterpart of the runtime resolver.

## Invariants / gotchas (shared with the consumers)

- **id ≤ 18630** (`allocateLodIds`) — see above.
- **IDE before IPL** in `gta.dat` (`patchGtaDat`).
- **IPL LOD-index coupling** — the static IPL links each HD `inst` to its LOD `inst` by a text-internal `lod`
  index; never reorder/partially strip those rows. ([[ipl-lod-index-coupling]])
- **retxd coverage gate** — never repoint a model to a TXD that doesn't cover its textures.
- **`UNDERWATER_PROCOBJ`** — never touched.

## Tests

`ide.test.ts`, `retxd.test.ts`, `txd-trim.test.ts`, `procobj-strip.test.ts`, `procobj/convert.test.ts` — each module unit-tested
(id allocation cap/determinism, coverage-gated retxd, the never-touch strip, MINDIST cull + IPL emit). Consumers
(`lod-trees-generator`, `lod-procobj-generator`) cover the end-to-end wiring.

## Consumers

`lod-trees-generator` (impostor placement), `lod-procobj-generator` (simplified-copy placement). Both also use
`@opensa/sa-lod` (see its [001](../../../lod-common/docs/plans/001-architecture.md)) and `@opensa/tool-kit`.
