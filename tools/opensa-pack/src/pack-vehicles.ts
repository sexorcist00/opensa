/**
 * Every car in `vehicles.ide` → `.osm` + `.ostex` archive edits (plan opensa-pack/003 phase 3).
 *
 * This is the first asset class to leave the RW parsers behind at runtime: afterwards the archives hold no
 * `<model>.dff` for a converted car, so a spawn is a section read. Phase 5 does the same for peds, clutter,
 * breakables, animated objects and map objects.
 *
 * The one judgement call is the TXD deletion. A car's `.ostex` bakes its whole dictionary chain, so its own
 * `.txd` is dead weight — but only if EVERY def naming that TXD converted, and only if it is not one of the
 * shared dictionaries other classes still parse by name. A TXD failing either test is KEPT and named in the
 * report, because a silently deleted dictionary is a silent no-texture.
