/**
 * One `.osm` per MODEL, not per asset class (plan opensa-pack/003 phase 5).
 *
 * A model belongs to as many classes as the data says: a cactus is a clutter species AND a breakable, a
 * crate is a topple prop AND a breakable. Each class contributes its own sections — `DESC`/`GEOM` from the
 * rigid build, `SHAT` from the shatter bake, collision from the COL — and they must land in ONE container.
 *
 * Emitting a file per class instead looks fine until two classes name the same model: the archive editor
 * dedupes inserts by name, so the second contribution is silently dropped and the model loses half its
 * sections. This accumulator is what makes that impossible.
