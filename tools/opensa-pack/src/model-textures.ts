/**
 * A MODEL's dictionary, planned from the RAW TXDs (plan opensa-pack/003 phase 5g).
 *
 * `packModelOstex` — the dictionary path vehicles, clutter and peds use — takes `buildVehicleModel`'s output,
 * and by then the mip chain is gone: `VehicleTextures` decoded level 0 and dropped the rest. That is fine for
 * a car (SA ships no mips for vehicles) and fatal for a map object: **95 % of the textures the mod packs
 * ship carry a chain**, up to 12 levels, and map-optimizer authors those chains deliberately.
 *
 * So a map object plans from the raw TXD instead — by reusing the WORLD planner, one instance per model.
 * That gets, for free and without a second implementation: the opaque-DXT pass-through that preserves the
 * source chain byte for byte, the `txdp` parent walk, the alpha pipeline for everything else, flat-colour
 * materials, and content dedup. A fresh instance numbers its arrays from 0, so `arrayRef` IS the model's
 * array index.
 *
 * It plans per BUILDER LAYER — `built.texture.names`, in the builder's own order — so the result doubles as
 * the remap table for `meta.x`: slot `i` is where builder layer `i` went. Planning the clump's materials
 * instead would leave the two orders to be matched up afterwards, and a mismatch there silently retextures
 * every submesh.
