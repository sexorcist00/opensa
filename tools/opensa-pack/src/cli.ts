/**
 * `opensa-pack` CLI (plan 074/03) — argv on top of {@link packGameDir}, nothing else. The convert itself is
 * a library (plan 003 phase 6), because its real home is a stage inside perfect-map-builder and a pipeline
 * stage must not go through argv.
 *
 *   npx tsx tools/opensa-pack/src/cli.ts --game <dir> --out <dir> [--rect x0,y0,x1,y1]
 *     [--no-ao] [--no-models] [--bakes] [--bake-workers N] [--textures astc|bc|rgba8] [--max-texture N]
 *     [--map-objects-in-rect]
 *     [--stochastic <file>[,<file>…]]
 *     [--checkpoints <dir> [--resume]]   per-chunk weld checkpoints (pmb plan 006); --resume continues from them
 *
 * REMOVED FLAGS (2026-07-19, user): `--cell-size` (the pak and the runtime must agree on it and nothing
 * checked that — it is the `CELL_SIZE` constant now), `--chunk-cells` (a welding tuning knob from the A2
 * speed work; the default stands), `--no-sunvis` (it said exactly what omitting `--bakes` says), and
 * `--wind` — whose wind-ADAPTED vegetation DFFs move into pmb config with the rest of the input data
 * (074/14). Until that lands, unadapted vegetation sways by height-above-base instead of authored
 * per-vertex weights. (`--in <mods-src>` went earlier, 2026-07-17, with the painted cloud panorama.)
 *
 * AO/skyVis is ON BY DEFAULT (2026-07-17 user decision — it replaces prod's SSAO, so a default pak must
 * carry it; `--no-ao` skips it for fast iteration reconverts). `--bakes` gates the HEAVY shadow bake
 * (sun-vis, 074/07): production, bench-ritual and pre-flip converts MUST pass it — without it the direct
 * sun renders unshadowed (bridges/canyons) by design.
 *
 * `--textures astc|bc|rgba8` picks the format the build WRITES — for the world arrays and every model
 * dictionary alike, because a GPU that cannot display one cannot display the other. `bc` (the default) passes
 * SA's own DXT blocks through untouched and is desktop-only. `astc` re-encodes to ASTC 4x4, which every
 * mobile GPU carries and which costs ONE byte per texel — the same as BC3 and a quarter of RGBA8; it costs
 * build time (the encode) and one generation of loss. `rgba8` leaves the pixels uncompressed: portable
 * everywhere, 4x an ASTC payload, and the reference when the question is about the encoder rather than the
 * pipeline. `--rgba8` is the older spelling of `--textures rgba8`.
 *
 * `--bake-collision` writes every cell's collision into the pak (`.oscol`, GAME grid) so the browser never
 * parses a COL — the largest named spike cost there is. Off by default while the runtime still reads the
 * archives; it costs build time and nothing reads the entries yet.
 *
 * `--platforms desktop|mobile[,…]` makes the build ASSERT it can run there. The pack always reports which GPU
 * families its textures allow (world arrays ∪ model dictionaries); naming one turns that report into a build
 * failure, which is the last moment the answer is ours rather than a stranger's phone.
 *
 * `--max-texture N` (power of two) caps every texture's edge, halving both axes together so aspect survives.
 * `--map-objects-in-rect` converts only the map objects `--rect` actually PLACES instead of all ~14 000 the
 * IDEs name — the district lever that turns a phone convert from hours into minutes. Needs an explicit
 * `--rect`; a model left out keeps its `.dff`, so the runtime parses one if anything ever asks for it.
 * With `--textures rgba8` it is what makes a district affordable: RGBA8 costs 4-8x its BC original, and one halving
 * takes three quarters of that back. A capped texture is decoded rather than passed through — a DXT block
 * cannot be resized without decoding it.
 *
 * `--rect` is inclusive GTA CELL coordinates (cell = floor(worldXY / CELL_SIZE)). OPTIONAL since plan 087:
 * the default auto-fits every cell with content — a fixed rect silently dropped whatever a TC placed
 * outside it (gostown's far islands). Pass it only to convert a deliberate SUBSET (bench districts).
 *
 * OUTPUT (plan 003 phase 1 + 086 phase 8): `--out` is a COPY of `--game` — the chain convention, so every
 * stage hands the next a complete game tree, and the game dir is SELF-CONTAINED: the pak products
 * (`world.ospak`, `manifest.json`, `water.bin`, `report.json`) go to `<out>/pak` (override with
 * `--pak-out`). Point a host at the game dir (`?src=<out>`).
