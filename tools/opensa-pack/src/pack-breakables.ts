/**
 * Smashable props → a `.osm` carrying their baked shatter mesh (plan opensa-pack/003 phase 5b).
 *
 * The runtime's first hit on a prop costs a whole `parseDff` on the MAIN thread, plus a scan for the
 * geometry holding the RW Breakable plugin — and for the props that ship none (boxes, bags) a synthesized
 * mesh built from the render geometry instead. None of that depends on anything but the asset, so it
 * happens here once.
 *
 * **The authored-vs-synthesized choice is resolved offline.** `shatterMeshOf` in the host picks
 * `getBreakable(...) ?? renderMeshOf(...)`, and the fallback is additionally capped at 65 535 vertices
 * because it reuses u16 indices. The writer runs the same decision and bakes the winner, so the reader has
 * no branch left to take.
 *
 * Only `SHAT` is written here. A prop that later gains geometry/collision sections keeps this one — that is
 * what a sectioned container is for.
