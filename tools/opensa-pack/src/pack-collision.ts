 * **The grid is the trap.** Collision streams on the GAME grid (`GAME_CELL_SIZE`, 256) while the pak's render
 * cells are 250 (`CELL_SIZE`) — two different tessellations of the same world. A bake keyed on the render
 * grid lands every collider in the wrong slot, and nothing catches it: the world renders, the player falls
 * through it in some places and stands on nothing in others. So the cell coordinates here are the CALLER's,
 * and the caller is responsible for having asked `buildCellColliders` on the same grid it writes the key
 * with. See `docs/restrictions/architecture.md`.
