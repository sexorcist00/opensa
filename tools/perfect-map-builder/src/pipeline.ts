 * What the built `sa/` tree COSTS in permanent text-IPL rows and inst-bearing IPL slots. **A census for the

 * lifts the int16 pool index where our data lands, so it is not a limit our content is designed against —
 * `docs/project-goals.md` directive 3). The slot half became {@link checkInstBearingIplSlots} on 2026-08-10,
 * when the field killed the belief that OLA lifts it too. The two halves of this function are now the two sides
 * of the same rule: **delete the museum pieces, keep the gates** — and which is which is answered by the
 * target, never by an ini.
 *
 * What died with the gate, and why it was never a gate worth having:
 *
 * - **the throw** failed every `sa` build to ration an install we do not build for. Past the 2026-08-09
 *   procobj column fix the layer alone costs 39 219 rows, so the condition was constant — and a condition that
 *   is always true is a print statement wearing a guard's clothes.
 * - **the `TEXT_ROW_CAP = 30000` budget** under it, 2 767 of unmeasured headroom below a ceiling that is itself
 *   lifted. It never shaped content: nothing culled to fit it. (What DOES shape rows is `linkedHeight` — short
 *   species ride binary streams at zero permanent rows — and lod-trees' per-area `AREA_ROW_CAP` migration.)
 * - **`--allow-text-row-overflow`**, which had nothing left to permit.
 * - **int16's 32 767 as printed scale** (field-bisected to exactly 2^15: 31 300 rows clean, 33 210 corrupt) —
 *   lifted by our asi, so printing it measured our build against a machine it never runs on. It lives in
 *   `docs/gta-sa-original/reference-install.md` and `docs/open-issues/fixed/ghost-barriers.md`.
 *   **`IplEntityIndexArrays` was dropped alongside it on the same reasoning and that was WRONG** — it is real,
 *   and it is back as a gate. The lesson is not "keep every ceiling": it is that "lifted" needs the artifact
 *   that enforces the limit to say so, and for this one nothing ever had.
 *
 * **This is not "guards are bad".** {@link checkImgIdBudgets} beside it still THROWS, and correctly: FLA's
 * pools are what the target is actually configured with — real numbers, not `unlimited` — and exhausting one
 * corrupts the heap during data load. It proved that on the first `sa` build after the density fix, which is
 * the difference between the two: a ceiling the target HAS is a gate, a ceiling it lifted is a museum piece.
 * A gate is answered by raising the number in the install's ini, never by shaping the build down to it.
 *
 * **The census names its own scope**, because both halves of it used to read a missing file as zero rows: an
 * IPL listed in `gta.dat` but absent on disk silently subtracted its rows, and an absent `gta.dat` skipped the
 * whole thing without a line. The error only ever ran DOWNWARD, so the count could only ever be falsely quiet —
 * and it is the number that prices the `CBuilding` pool (013's deferred task), so a lower bound sold as a total
 * is a wrong answer to a question we have not asked yet.
 *
 * Runs on the BUILT `sa/` tree, like {@link checkImgIdBudgets} — never on the shared build, which undercounts
 * it (the sa LOD stage appends hole-fill instances to the text IPLs after the split).
