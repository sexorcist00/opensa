/**
 * Model ids for content the game never had — allocated over a BUILT tree, deterministically.
 *
 * The window and the determinism are both decisions, not conveniences (central plan 102, the user's call
 * 2026-08-19):
 *
 * - **19 001–19 999.** SA's map allocators stop at 19 000 (`docs/edge-cases/sa-formats.md`) and FLA's DFF
 *   range ends at 19 999, so this window belongs to added content alone and the two never meet. Measured on
 *   the built tree the day it was chosen: **0 ids in use there, 999 free**, against a demand of 161.
 * - **Deterministic, and a LEDGER wins over order.** A parked car and a ModelVariations entry land in the
 *   SAVE (`docs/gta-sa-original/fla-id-limits-are-part-of-the-savefile.md`), so an id that moved between two
 *   builds is a save that spawns the wrong car. Ids are handed out in the caller's order, skipping whatever
 *   the tree already uses — but a slot the ledger already knows keeps ITS id whatever the order became.
 *   Deleting the ledger is the only way to renumber, and the tool that owns it says so.
