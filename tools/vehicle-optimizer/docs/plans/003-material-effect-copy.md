# 003 — Reflection-strength transfer (env-map coefficient + reflection intensity)

**Status: ✅ Implemented (cascade matching, cross-vehicle).** (`adapters/gta-sa/copy-effects.ts`).
**Studied and corrected 2026-08-18 after a field report ("the prototype settings are not applied").** Two
findings, and the first one reverses the obvious fix: **the env-map is the author's marking of which surface
reflects** (body, glass, chrome — yankee 33 of 116, admiral 67 of 91), while the SA reflection plugin sits on
nearly EVERY material (yankee 116 of 116, walton 180 of 180). Retuning by the plugin instead spreads the
reference's body value onto tyres, dirt and interior, and takes the reference's level from its untuned
majority — measured on the reported pair, the median flips 0.16 → 0.50 and the copy transfers nothing.
So the marked set stays the selector on both sides, with a fallback for a tree that has none. What DID change:
a deliberate **0** is never written to (admiral carries 19 such env-map chunks), a target with no marked
material falls back to its reflection-carrying ones instead of being refused, and the run PRINTS what it
did — see the ledger.
`--prototype <path>` transfers **only the reflection strength** — the env-map `coefficient` (+ optional
`reflection` intensity) — from a well-tuned reference onto a target whose reflection is overdone. We do **not**
copy materials/effects wholesale: textures, colour, geometry, and _which_ materials reflect are all left alone;
we only retune the numbers on the target's **existing** reflective materials. Worst case: a part a touch too
shiny/matte — never structurally broken.

**Why this shape.** Some mods crank the env-map coefficient to ~1 (mirror-like, garish); a tasteful model like
`walton` uses ~0.5. The goal is to copy _that number_, not the material. So the prototype is read with the
**engine `parseDff`** (read-only) — which means anti-rip-**locked** references like `walton.dff` work as the
"good" reference — and only its `coefficient`/`intensity` values are read. The target (a standard DFF being
fixed) is read+patched with map-optimizer's byte codec, writing the new floats straight into its env-map
(`0x120`, coefficient @ offset 8) and reflection (`0x253f2fc`, intensity @ offset 16) plugin chunks.

**Matching — cascade, cross-vehicle (no index lock-step).** Per target reflective material: (1) by shared base
**texture name** (common SA textures, body paint); (2) else the prototype's **representative** value (median
coefficient/intensity across its reflective materials); (3) if nothing matches, best-effort representative. No
count match needed — different vehicles just work; a non-reflective prototype/target throws a clear error.
Verified: `walton`→`infernus` retunes infernus's overdone coefficient `1` → walton's `0.5` (intensity →
walton's median `0.07`) with the reflective/total material counts unchanged, **with walton locked**; cross-count
`admiral`→`infernus` no longer throws.

## What's transferred (just two scalars)

Only the **reflection strength** values, read from the prototype's `RWMaterial.effects`:

- **env-map `coefficient`** — the main "mirror-ness" knob (the overdone case sets this near 1),
- **reflection `intensity`** — secondary, patched only when the target material already has a reflection plugin.

Textures (incl. the env-map texture reference), colour, UV scale/offset, specular, and geometry are **not**
touched, and no reflection is added to or removed from a material — we only overwrite these two floats on the
target's already-reflective materials. (Specular was considered and left out — coefficient + intensity cover the
"too shiny" case with the least blast radius.)

## The crux — matching across different vehicles

Reference and target usually differ in material count/textures, so there's no 1:1 index map. The cascade:

1. **By base texture name** — a target material whose base texture matches a prototype reflective material's
   takes that material's coefficient/intensity (shared SA textures, body paint).
2. **Representative fallback** — otherwise the prototype's **median** coefficient (+ median intensity) across its
   reflective materials. So "both are reflective" is enough to transfer the tasteful level.
3. **Best-effort** — if nothing matches, the representative still applies; a prototype/target with _no_
   reflective materials throws a clear error (nothing to copy / nothing to retune).

Only target materials that **already** reflect are touched, so matte parts stay matte and the material structure
is preserved.

## Reuse vs. new

- **Reuse:** `../src` DFF parser (`RWMaterial.effects`, read-only — for the tests/inspection); **`../map-optimizer`**
  chunk codec (outer tree down to each Geometry's Material List leaf) + its `writeRw`.
- **New (done):** a **material-aware chunk walker** (re-parses the Material List leaf into Material/Texture/
  Extension containers); **verbatim effect-chunk copy** (no re-encoding — the plugins, incl. MatFX's embedded
  env-map texture, are copied whole); the index matcher; the `process` prototype path.

## Risks

- **Matching** — the open question. MVP (texture name + body) covers common cars; unusual material setups may
  mis-match → a part too shiny/matte. Low blast radius (effects only), easy to inspect via `--model <path>`
  (the report shows which materials carry effects).
- **Extension writer** — must insert/replace the plugin chunks without disturbing the rest of the material
  Extension (UV-anim, etc.); validate by parse→copy→re-parse round-trip.
- **Env-map texture availability** — if the reference's env-map texture isn't in the target's TXD, the effect
  references a missing texture; keep the target's own env-map texture name when only copying coefficients, or
  ensure the standard `vehicleenvmap128` is present.
- **Verification** — in-game: target gains the reference's reflective look; matte parts stay matte.

## Scope

- **In:** copy reflection/specular/env-map by texture-name match + body fallback; strip effects where the
  reference role has none; combine with `--scale` in one run.
- **Out:** colour/texture/geometry; full material replacement; non-vehicle materials.

## Ledger — the 2026-08-18 field report

`yankee.dff` (a 43-part mod truck, everything at the default 0.5) with `yosemite.dff` as the prototype.
Measured per texture, which is what settled it:

| yosemite (reference) | intensity | | yankee (target) | intensity |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `remap1` (paint) ×15 | **0.07** | | `tga_body` ×14 | 0.50 |
| `chrome_gl` ×25 | **0.16** | | `(untextured)` ×36 | 0.50 |
| `glasswindows2` ×8 | **0.06** | | everything else | 0.50 |
| `gen_mirror128` ×6 | **0.19** | | | |
| scratches / dirt / lights / leather | 0.50 (untouched) | | | |

Its full histogram is `0.50×141, 0.16×31, 0.07×25, 0.06×12, 0.19×10, 0.05×2, 0.04×1` — so **the median over
every reflective material is 0.50, the file's default**, and only the median over the ENV-MAP-MARKED ones is the
author's actual level (**0.16**). That is why the marked set is the selector: it is simultaneously the right
target set and the right reference population.

The run now reports itself, and on this pair it does the thing the field remembered:

```
scale ×1.05 — geometry, dummy rig and collision
effects: 33 of 116 material(s) retuned (33 env-map coefficient, 33 reflection intensity); 0 matched the
         prototype by texture name, the rest took its median [coefficient 0.500, intensity 0.160]
```

`tga_body` goes 0.50 → **0.16**; the 83 unmarked materials (interior, tyres, plates, dirt) keep 0.50, exactly
as the reference leaves its own. Texture-name matching contributed **0 of 33** here — two independent authors
share no material names (46 vs 16 distinct, only generic `vehiclelights128`/plate/scratch overlap), so the
median stage is what runs in practice and the per-name stage is a bonus for same-author families.

**Not built, and the honest next step if per-part character is wanted:** match by something both cars share —
the part/dummy the geometry hangs off (`chassis`, `bonnet`, `door_*`, `wheel_*`, `windscreen`) or a material
ROLE derived from it (body / glass / chrome / interior / tyre) — instead of the texture name. That is a plan of
its own, not a patch to this one.
